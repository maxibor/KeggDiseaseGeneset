NAME        B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a clonal stem cell malignancy of excessive lymphoblast proliferation. It is now understood that ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the same disease entities at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels and classified as either B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL and T-ALL). In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) "Philadelphia" chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners. If none of these specific genetic abnormalities are found, the designation of "B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, not otherwise specified," is appropriate.

NAME        T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a clonal stem cell malignancy of excessive lymphoblast proliferation. It is now understood that ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the same disease entities at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels and classified as either B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL and T-ALL). T-ALL comprises 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. T cell transformation is a multi-step process in which different genetic alterations cooperate to alter the normal mechanisms that control cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation during thymocyte development. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. In addition, T-ALLs characteristically show the translocation and aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes. These oncogenic transcription factors include T-cell leukaemia homeobox protein 1 (TLX1 also known as HOX11), TLX3 (HOX11L2), LYL1, TAL1 and MLL.

ENTRY       H00003                      Disease
NAME        Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
DESCRIPTION Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases,  the transcription factors themselves are mutated.

NAME        Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
DESCRIPTION Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22.  The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.

NAME        Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
DESCRIPTION B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is caused by the abnormal progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent monoclonal B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. It is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, accounting for about 30% of total leukaemias. Worldwide there are approximately 180,000 new cases every year. A main focus in CLL research involved the evaluation of genetic features related to somatic gene mutation or deletions that disrupt apoptosis and enhance tumor cell proliferation. The best characterized genes are TP53 (also known as p53) and ATM, for which mutations and/or deletions have been described that predict rapid disease progression, resistance to conventional therapies and poor survival.

NAME        Hairy-cell leukemia
DESCRIPTION Hairy cell Leukemia (HCL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that is defined, according to the WHO classification, as a mature (peripheral) B-cell neoplasm. HCL accounts for between 2-3% of all leukemia cases, with about 600 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. With regard to genetic abnormalities of potential pathogenetic importance in HCL, only a few have been described. Mutations of p53 and Bcl-6 have been reported in about one-third of cases, but their functional significance is unclear. Over-expression of cyclin D1, an important cell cycle regulator, has been reported in cases of HCL as well as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and in a few cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia among lymphoid malignancies.

NAME        Hodgkin lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).

NAME        Burkitt lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma consisting of endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated variants. Endemic BL (eBL) affects children and young adults in Africa and some other geographical areas and carries Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in more than 95% of cases. In contrast, sporadic BL (sBL) among adolescents in Europe and North America are mostly EBV-negative. A third type of BL is associated with HIV-infection in adults. All of these subtypes possess chromosomal rearrangements of the c-myc oncogene, the genetic hallmark of BL that contributes to lymphomagenesis through alterations in cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, cellular adhesion, and metabolism. Many BL carry point mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or other defects in the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway, and inactivation of the p16INK4a gene by promoter methylation or homozygous deletion. This indicates that disruption of both the pRb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways is critical for BL development.

NAME        Adult T-cell leukemia
DESCRIPTION Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies and is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). The HTLV-I Tax protein has been demonstrated to be the oncogenic protein of the virus. Tax may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including upregulating the expression of cellular genes involved in T cell growth and proliferation, including IL-2, IL-2R-alpha, and IL-15. However, ATL cells do not always need Tax expression in the later stage of leukemogenesis. Genetic and epigenetic changes should be implicated in such multistep leukemogenesis. Regarding genetic changes, mutation of p53, and deletion of p16 have been reported in ATL. Mutations of Fas gene are also reported in patients with ATL cells. However, such genetic changes were not frequently detected. In this regard, epigenetic change of p16/INK4A gene was more frequent in ATL cells, and accumulated according to the disease progression. This finding suggests that epigenetic change, including DNA methylation, plays an important role in the leukemogenesis of ATL.

NAME        Multiple myeloma
DESCRIPTION Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.

NAME        Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype characterized by small B-lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and plasma cells, usually involving bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the spleen. WM can be distinguished clinically from LPL on the basis of a detectable monoclonal (IgM) immunoglobulin spike in serum. In the general population, LPL/WM is a very rare disease, accounting for only 1%-2% of all hematologic malignancies, reflected in an incidence rate of 3-4 cases per million people per year. The t(9;14)(p13;q32) is present in near 50% of cases of LPL. This chromosomal translocation involves a junction between 9p13 and the switch micro region of the Ig heavy chain locus on 14q32. The 9p13 breakpoint contains the PAX-5 gene which encodes a B-cell specific transcription factor involved in the control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. The translocation causes the juxtaposition of the PAX-5 gene to the IgH locus in the opposite direction of transcription, resulting in an 11-fold over-expression of PAX-5 mRNA.

NAME        Polycythemia vera
DESCRIPTION Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by an erythroid dominant trilineage proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells. PV belongs to the family of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), which includes hematological diseases that share clinical and biological similarities, such as a hematopoietic stem cell origin: PV, essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some types of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), systemic mast cell disease (SMD) and other rare disorders. Recently, a specific point mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene was described in a majority of PV patients and thus constitutes a sensitive diagnostic marker for the disease.

NAME        Small cell lung cancer
DESCRIPTION Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases.  Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.

NAME        Non-small cell lung cancer
DESCRIPTION Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a  inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.

NAME        Malignant pleural mesothelioma
DESCRIPTION Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.

NAME        Oral cancer
DESCRIPTION Oral cancer refers to a subgroup of head and neck malignancies that develop at the lips, tongue, salivary glands, gingiva, floor of the mouth, oropharynx, buccal surfaces and other intra-oral locations, according to the International Classification of Diseases. Nevertheless, the term is synonymous to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of oral mucosal origin that accounts for more than 90% of all malignant presentations at the aforementioned anatomical sites. Worldwide, oral SCC (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer; more than 300,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. The development of OSCC is a multistep process requiring the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations, influenced by a patient's genetic predisposition as well as by environmental influences, including tobacco, alcohol, chronic inflammation, and viral infection. The genetic changes include activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alterations of tumor suppressors p53 and p16, and cyclin D1 overexpression.

ENTRY       H00017                      Disease
NAME        Esophageal cancer
DESCRIPTION Esophageal cancer represents the 9th leading cancer in the world and is associated with a 5-year survival rate under 25%. The two main forms are squamous-cell carcinoma (ECSC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). ECSC is the most frequent histological subtype in esophageal cancer, although the incidence of EAC is increasing faster than any other malignancy in the western world. Whereas ESCC can be attributed to alcohol and tobacco consumption, the most important risk factor for the development of EAC is duodenal-gastric-esophageal reflux. In the process of tumorigenesis at the cellular level, multiple genetic alterations are involved, including mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of cyclin D1 gene, among others.

NAME        Gastric cancer
DESCRIPTION Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. There is substantial international variation in gastric cancer incidence with the highest rates reported from Korea, Japan and eastern Asia. The global burden of gastric cancer is shifting rapidly from the developed world to the developing world. Despite the worldwide decline in incidence and the major improvements in diagnosis and treatment, less than 20% of patients survive to 5 years. Phenotypically, gastric cancer is divided into two histomorphological entities denominated 'intestinal' (IGCA) and 'diffuse' (DGCA), which differ in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical outcome and genetic profile. The risk of both IGCA and DGCA is increased in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection, and the risk rises with increases in grade and extent of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. Mutations and/or amplification/overexpression of the oncogenes c-K-ras, c-erbB-2, K-sam and c-met, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes p53, APC and DCC, and abnormal transcription of CD44 are believed to play a role in gastric carcinogenesis but seem to vary in frequency between IGCA and DGCA. E-cadherin/CDH1 gene germline mutations have been recognized in families with an inherited predisposition to DGCA.

NAME        Pancreatic cancer
DESCRIPTION Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways.  Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.

NAME        Colorectal cancer
DESCRIPTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).

NAME        Renal cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.

NAME        Bladder cancer
DESCRIPTION The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of  E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

NAME        Testicular cancer
DESCRIPTION Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) comprises about 98% of all testicular neoplasms and is thereby the most common malignancy among young males. Overall, three different entities of TGCT can be distinguished: teratomas and yolk sac tumors of newborns and infants, seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of adolescents and young adults, and spermatocytic seminoma of elderly men. Recent studies of TGCTs have suggested that overexpression of cyclin D2 is a very early, possibly the oncogenic, event in GC tumorigenesis.

NAME        Prostate cancer
DESCRIPTION Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.

NAME        Penile cancer
DESCRIPTION Penile cancer is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These alterations have been described in both HPV-positive and -negative penile cancers.

NAME        Endometrial Cancer
DESCRIPTION Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological malignancy and the fourth most common malignancy in women in the developed world after breast, colorectal and lung cancer. Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. The morphologic differences in these cancers are mirrored in their molecular genetic profile with type I showing defects in DNA-mismatch repair and mutations in PTEN, K-ras, and beta-catenin, and type II showing aneuploidy, p53 mutations, and her2/neu amplification.

NAME        Ovarian cancer
DESCRIPTION Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in developed countries. Approximately 90% of human ovarian cancer arises within the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), with the rest originating from granulosa cells or, rarely, stroma or germ cells. Ovarian epithelial tumors are divided into mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and clear cell subtypes. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers arise in women who have inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). The vast majority of ovarian cancers are sporadic, resulting from the accumulation of genetic damage over a lifetime. Several specific genes involved in ovarian carcinogenesis have been identified, including the p53 tumor suppressor gene and ERBB2 and PIK3CA oncogenes.

NAME        Choriocarcinoma
DESCRIPTION Gestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant epithelial tumor that can be associated with any type of gestational event, most often a complete hydatidiform mole (CM). CM occur in about one per 1000 pregnancies, and about 5-20% of CM progress to invasive moles or choriocarcinoma. Several molecular studies have been done to establish the expression of tumor-associated proteins in choriocarcinoma. In the p53 pathway, overexpression of the p53 protein and the p53-associated protein, MDM2, have been detected. Synergistic upregulation of c-MYC, c-ERB-2, c-FMS, and BCL-2 oncoproteins have also been suggested to have an important role in the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma. Moreover, choriocarcinomas have been shown to express increased concentrations of MMP and decreased concentrations of TIMP to help with tumor invasion and metastasis.

NAME        Vulvar cancer
DESCRIPTION Vulvar cancer is a relatively uncommon malignancy, occurring at a rate of 2.2 per 100,000 women per year. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of vulvar cancer and is observed in 80% to 90% of cases. There are at least two quite different types of SCC of the vulva. The less common, accounting for about one-third of cases, occurs in relatively young women, is usually preceded by the undifferentiated form of vulvar squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the more frequent form develops in elderly patients, is not commonly associated with undifferentiated VIN but is frequently associated with differentiated VIN, lichen sclerosus or squamous hyperplasia, and is generally not linked to HPV infection. Relatively little is known about molecular changes in the genesis of vulvar cancer. Some studies suggest that early p53 mutation may be a defining step only in HPV-negative tumors. A rather small study suggests that mutation in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is an early change in a substantial subset of vulvar carcinomas.

NAME        Cervical cancer
DESCRIPTION Cervical cancer is the second largest cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, and it occurs following persistent infection, sometimes for decades, with a specific subset of human papillomavirus (HPV) types, particularly types 16, 18, 33 and 42. Experimental studies show that the E6 and E7 genes of these high risk HPVs are oncogenes that deregulate key cell cycle controls. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins bind respectively to the p53 and Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, which are involved in the regulation of growth control. The abnormalities in other cellular genes found in cervical cancer, including mutations in ras family of genes, and amplification in EGFR and ERBB2, may also play an important role in carcinogenesis and the aggressiveness of cervical tumors, although to date the role of most of these genetic abnormalities does not appear to be as important as the role of HPV.

NAME        Breast cancer
DESCRIPTION Breast cancer remains the most common malignancy in women worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. More than 1-2 million cases are diagnosed every year, affecting 10-12% of the female population and accounting for 500 000 deaths per year worldwide. Approximately 5-10% are thought to be inherited. The hereditary breast cancer syndrome includes genetic alterations in various susceptibility genes such as p53, PTEN, BRCA1, and BRCA2. Sporadic breast cancers result from a serial stepwise accumulation of acquired and uncorrected mutations in somatic genes, without any germline mutation playing a role. Oncogenes that have been reported to play an early role in sporadic breast cancer are MYC, CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and ERBB2 (HER2/neu). In sporadic breast cancer, mutational inactivation of BRCA1/2 is rare. However, non-mutational functional suppression could result from various mechanisms, such as hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter.

NAME        Thyroid cancer
DESCRIPTION Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and accounts for the majority of endocrine cancer- related deaths each year. More than 95% of thyroid carcinomas are derived from follicular cells.  Their behavior varies from the indolent growing, well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas (PTC and FTC, respectively) to the extremely aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma (UC). Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. The most distinctive molecular features of FTC are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR{gamma} rearrangements. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma.

NAME        Adrenal carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy defined by a heterogeneous clinical presentation, dismal prognosis, and lack of effective therapeutic regimens. The incidence of ACC ranges from 0.5 to 2 cases per million people per year, accounting for 0.02% of all reported cancers. Unfortunately, most patients present with metastatic disease which reduces the 5 year survival rate to less than 10%. Oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in adrenal carcinomas include mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene and rearrangements of the chromosomal locus 11p15.5 associated with IGF II hyperexpression. Deletions of the ACTH receptor gene have recently been found in undifferentiated adenomas and in aggressive ACCs.

NAME        Carcinoid
DESCRIPTION Carcinoid tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms that nonetheless comprise up to 85% of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal neoplasms. They most frequently occur in the midgut and develop from neuroendocrine cells that are normally and diffusely present in this location. Most carcinoids are sporadic but epidemiological studies report a familial risk. Moreover, carcinoids can occur within the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, a rare familiar tumor syndrome in which mutations in the MEN1 gene are manifested. Recently, it has been shown that a majority (78%) of sporadic carcinoids display loss of heterozygosity for markers around the MEN 1 region, thus suggesting involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic carcinoids.

NAME        Ewing's sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor occurring in children and young adults, and accounts for 10-15% of all primary bone tumors. The annual incidence is approximately 0.6/million total population, and it usually occurs between the ages of 10 and 20 years. Ewing's sarcoma is in 85% of cases associated with the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12), which leads to the formation of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene. In another 10-15% of cases the translocation t(21;12)(22;12) generates the EWSR1-ERG fusion, whereas the remaining 1-5% of cases may harbor one of several possible translocations, each resulting in a fusion gene containing a portion of the EWSR1 gene and a member of the ETS family of transcription factors.

NAME        Osteosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer. Approximately 900 new cases of osteosarcoma are diagnosed each year in the United States. The presentation of this disease is bimodal, with peaks in adolescence and after the age of 50 years. The tumors typically arise in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, with the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus representing the three most common sites. Genomic amplification, especially of both the p53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors. Alterations of Rb1 and c-myc are also common, and mutations have been reported in p53, p16INK4A, and CDKN2B.

NAME        Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are soft tissue sarcomas that are one of the most common neoplasms in children and adolescents. RMSs are presumed to be associated with the skeletal muscle lineage, although those tumors can be present in organs histologically lacking skeletal muscle, like prostate, urinary bladder or gallbladder. RMS comprises a heterogeneous into two major histologic subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a pediatric sarcoma that typically occurs in older children predominantly arising in the trunk and extremities, and exhibits a worse prognosis than other types of RMSs. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FOXO1A and PAX7-FOXO1A fusion products, respectively. These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways.

NAME        Malignant melanoma
DESCRIPTION Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations.  Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways. MITF and TP53 are implicated in further melanoma progression.

NAME        Basal cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Cancer of the skin is the most common cancer in Caucasians and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) account for 90% of all skin cancers. The vast majority of BCC cases are sporadic, though there is a rare familial syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, or Gorlin syndrome) that predisposes to development of BCC. In addition, there is strong epidemiological and genetic evidence that demonstrates UV exposure as a risk factor of prime importance. The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (>50%) in sporadic BCC.

NAME        Squamous cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most frequent tumors and their number is still increasing world- wide. Approximately 200000 cases of SCC develop per year, causing about 2000 deaths. Unlike BCCs, which have no known precursor lesions, SCCs can emerge from actinic keratoses. SCC in anogenital regions can be caused by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) strains. As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs.

NAME        Kaposi's sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disease occurring in several different clinical-epidemiological forms that, however, share the same histological traits and are all associated with infection by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8; also known as KSHV). Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.

NAME        Glioma
DESCRIPTION Gliomas are the most common of the primary brain tumors and account for more than 40% of all central nervous system neoplasms. Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma).  Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.

NAME        Neuroblastoma
DESCRIPTION Neuroblastoma is a tumor derived from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous system and is the most common solid tumor in childhood. Approximately one-half of children have localized tumors that can be cured with surgery alone. These favorable tumors are characterized by near-triploid karyotypes with whole chromosome gains. These tumors rarely have structural rearrangements, and they usually express the TrkA neurotrophin receptor. Patients with these tumors are more likely to be less than 1 year of age. The remaining children have widespread metastatic disease or quite large, aggressive, localized tumors. These unfavorable tumors are characterized by structural changes, including deletions of 1p or 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and/or amplification of the MYCN protooncogene. They might also express the TrkB neurotrophin receptor and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These patients are usually older than 1 year of age, and have a poor long-term survival rate of approximately 30%.

NAME        Cancer of the anal canal
DESCRIPTION Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal accounts for 1.5 per cent of all digestive system cancers in the USA, with an estimated 4,660 new cases and 660 deaths in 2006. Epidemiological and molecular-biology studies have now shown that sexually transmitted infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important aetiological agent. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also associated with anal cancer. HPV infection is transient in most immunocompetent individuals, but HIV-positive patients have evidence of persistent HPV infection within the anal canal. Current data suggest that mutations in p53, DCC and APC tumor suppressor genes contribute to the stepwise progression of anal squamous cell carcinoma in immunocompetent individuals.

NAME        Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
DESCRIPTION Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), also known as islet cell tumors, are rare neoplasms that arise in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas. They may occur sporadically or in association with a genetic syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Von Hippel-Landau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, or tuberous sclerosis. The most frequent genetic alterations in PNET occur in MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia-1 Gene), DAXX/ATRX (Death-Domain Associated Protein/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked Genes) and the mTOR pathway (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin). A germline mutation in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene causes MEN1, the above-mentioned autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome. Mutations of DAXX and ATRX are common and related to altered telomeres but not to prognosis.

NAME        Cholangiocarcinoma
DESCRIPTION Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm that carries a poor prognosis and lacks effective therapy. It is the second most common primary hepatic tumor, and it is increasing in incidence and carries a high mortality. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree, either within the liver (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: ICC) or more commonly from the extrahepatic bile ducts (extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Several studies have demonstrated mutations resulting in overexpression of K-ras and p53 genes. These genetic alterations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype in this cancer. Many reports have implicated overexpression of the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogenes c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) and c-Met, as well as cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

DESCRIPTION Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a relatively uncommon neoplasm, however its prognosis is poor with less than a 5% 5-year survival rate. There are considerable geographic differences in its incidence and etiology. Two main pathways of GBC pathogenesis have been identified. The most common is associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, whereas a second, less frequent pathway is associated with a congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction, which is particularly common in Japan. TP53 inactivation has an important and early role in GBC associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation. Although KRAS mutations are rarely detected in GBC associated with gallstones, they are frequent and early events in tumors associated with congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction.

NAME        Hepatocellular carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer and one of the rare human neoplasms etiologically linked to viral factors. Chronic infections with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been implicated in about 80% of cases worldwide, and other known environmental risk factors, including alcohol abuse and dietary intake of aflatoxin B1, might synergize with viral infections. Recent studies have discovered genetic and epigenetic changes involved in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, including mutations in Rb1, AXIN1, p53, IGFR-II/M6PR, p16, E-Cadherin, and PTEN. The most frequently mutated genes in HCC include p53 and beta-catenin, although mutation prevalence varies greatly depending on etiology.

NAME        Myxoid liposarcoma
DESCRIPTION Liposarcoma(LS) represents the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of adults and occurs most often in the thigh and retroperitoneum. LSs are subclassified into well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic types. The myxoid type, the most common subtype, accounts for approximately 40% to 54% of all liposarcomas. The karyotypic hallmark of myxoid LS is the t(12;16)(q13;p11), present cytogenetically in >90% of the cases. The translocation leads to the fusion of the DDIT3(CHOP) and FUS(TLS) genes at 12q13 and 16p11, respectively, and the generation of a FUS-DDIT3 hybrid protein. In 4 cases of myxoid LS, a variant chromosomal translocation has been described, t(12;22), in which DDIT3 fuses instead with EWSR1(EWS), a gene highly related to TLS.

NAME        Synovial sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Synovial sarcomas account for 7% to 10% of all human soft-tissue sarcomas. The tumors arise at any age, but affect mainly young adults and more commonly males. Clinically, they appear as deep-seated slowly growing masses. In more than half of the cases, metastases develop, primarily to the lungs but also to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. A specific translocation, t(X; 18)(p11.2; q11.2), is found in more than 90% of reported synovial sarcoma, including biphasic, monophasic, and poorly differentiated tumors. The breakpoints of the t(X; 18) have been cloned and shown to involve the fusion of the SYT gene at 18q11 to either of two highly homologous genes at Xp11 called SSX1 and SSX2. The SYT-SSX1 fusion is associated with biphasic morphology and a worse prognosis, whereas the SYT-SSX2 fusion tends to show monophasic morphology and better outcome.

NAME        Alveolar soft part sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, histologically distinctive soft-tissue sarcoma typically occurring in children and young adults. Although it displays a relatively indolent clinical course, the ultimate prognosis is poor and is often characterised by late metastases. ASPS is characterised by an unbalanced translocation: der(17)t(X:17)(p11;q25). This translocation causes the fusion of the TEF3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3) with a novel gene at 17q25, named ASPL. Translocation between chromosomes X and 17 is seen in all the tested cases, implicating transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis of this tumor.

NAME        Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue
DESCRIPTION Soft tissue sarcomas account for only about 1% of all malignant diseases and there are less than 8,700 new cases per year in the United States. Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), a highly malignant tumor of deep soft tissues is perhaps the rarest of these. CCS is characterized by the translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12). This translocation rearranges the ATF1 gene at 12q13 and the EWSR1 gene at 22q12, originating an EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene. Given its specificity, this genetic aberration is considered pathognomonic for CCS and can be used as a diagnostic marker of this neoplasia.

NAME        Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a unique, rare soft-tissue tumor with prominent myxoid morphology. The tumor most commonly develops in deep parts of the proximal extremities and limb girdles in middle-aged adults, and there is a predilection for male patients. Currently, a chromosomal translocation t(9;22)(q22;q12) and the resultant fusion gene, EWSR1-NR4A3, has been defined in approximately 75% of EMC. More recently, another fusion gene, TAF15-NR4A3, resulting from t(9;17)(q22;q11.2), has been identified. The abnormal proteins resulting from these fusion genes aberrantly affect gene transcription and cellular signaling pathways thought to be responsible for initiating sarcoma formation.

ENTRY       H00054                      Disease
NAME        Nasopharyngeal cancer
DESCRIPTION Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare disease in most parts of the world, with an age-standardised annual incidence of less than 1 per 100000. However, in Southern China, parts of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean basin, NPC is an endemic disease with an incidence of 10-30 per 100000. Genome-wide studies have unravelled multiple chromosomal abnormalities with involvement of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Alterations of genes such as Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), p16/INK4A, p14/ARF suggest that multiple cellular pathways were dysregulated in the NPC cells. Studies on the precancerous lesions revealed early genetic changes and a critical role of Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) latent infection in the development of this cancer.

ENTRY       H00055                      Disease
NAME        Laryngeal cancer
DESCRIPTION Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in Europe, with about 52,000 new cases per year, 90% of them occurring in men. Smoke and alcohol represent the major behavioral risk factors. Of all laryngeal cancers, some 95% are squamous cell carcinomas. Some molecular events have been described in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Although tumor suppressor inactivation of p53 and p16 is common in these tumors (about 50% each), oncogenic activation is less well characterized. Cyclin D1 and epidermal growth factor receptor amplification have been reported in one-third and one-quarter of LSCCs, respectively, both related to advanced stages, whereas c-myc could be amplified in 13% of cases although without associated overexpression.

ENTRY       H00056                      Disease
NAME        Alzheimer's disease (AD)
DESCRIPTION Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.

ENTRY       H00057                      Disease
NAME        Parkinson's disease (PD)
DESCRIPTION Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1 (a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1), parkin, DJ1 (a parkin-associated protein involved with oxidative stress), and PINK1 (a putative serine threonine kinase) are known to cause early-onset PD. Mutations or altered expression of these proteins contributes to the damage and subsequent loss of DA neurons through common mechanisms that result in proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum. This results in a reduced activation of the direct pathway and in a disinhibition of the indirect pathway, which is associated with the elevation of adenosine A2A receptor transmission. Such unbalanced activity of the striatal output pathway is at the basis of the motor impairment observed in PD.

ENTRY       H00058                      Disease
NAME        Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS);
            Lou Gehrig's disease
DESCRIPTION Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial ALS (FALS) cases, is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins. Nitration may target neurofilament proteins, affecting axonal transport. Collectively, these mechanisms are predicted to disturb cellular homeostasis, ultimately triggering motor neuron death.

ENTRY       H00059                      Disease
NAME        Huntington's disease (HD)
DESCRIPTION Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2+ signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF. While mHtt binds to p53 and upregulates levels of nuclear p53 as well as p53 transcriptional activity. Augmented p53 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction.

NAME        Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)
DESCRIPTION Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of the CAG repeat diseases like Huntington's disease. It is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the atrophin 1 gene and shows various combinations of clinical symptoms depending on the age of onset. The clinical features of DRPLA include progressive myoclonus, seizure, and mental retardation in patients with an earlier onset (generally < 20 years) and cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis, and dementia in patients with a later onset (> 40 years).

DESCRIPTION Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.

It is an X-linked recessive disease that only affects males. SBMA is caused by expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene. The expansion of encoded polyglutamine tracts results in protein aggregation and is associated with neuronal cell death.

ENTRY       H00063                      Disease
NAME        Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)
DESCRIPTION The dominantly inherited ataxias or spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of progressive disorders which characteraized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, eyes/oculomotor deficits, gait ataxia and dysarthria ataxia.The prevalence of SCAs is estimated to be 1-4/100.000. At least 28 genetic loci for SCAs had been discovered. SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17 are caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode a pure repeat of the amino acid glutamine in the disease protein. SCA8, 10 and 12 are due to repeat expansions outside of the protein-coding region of the respective disease genes. SCA5, 13, 14 and 27 are caused by conventional mutations in specific genes: deletion, missense, nonsense and splice site mutations.

DESCRIPTION Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder with a birth frequency of about 1 in 300 000. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with abnormal eye movements and cutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, and premature aging. The product of the causative gene ATM is a 350 kDa protein of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family that is involved in mitogenic signal transduction, intracellular protein transport, and cell cycle control.

DESCRIPTION Lewy Body dementia (LDB) is neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, mild parkinsonism, and fluctuations in attention and alertness. It is the second most-common degenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive Lewy Bodies is seen in the brainstem, the limbic system or cortical and subcortical regions, depending on disease subtype. The genetic risk factors include alpha-synuclein mutations and SNCA locus triplicationslocus triplications. Mutations of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have also been implicated in familial DLB.

ENTRY       H00067                      Disease
NAME        Friedreich ataxia
DESCRIPTION Friedreich ataxia is one of the most common forms of autosomal recessive ataxia caused by severely reduced levels of frataxin as a result of a large GAA triplet-repeat expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene. Frataxin deficiency is thought to cause generation of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species and mitochondrial dysfunction.

NAME        Leber hereditary optic atrophy (LHON);
            Leber optic atrophy
DESCRIPTION Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally transmitted inherited genetic disease underlying mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It is primarily an ophthalmological disorder, presenting predominantly in young adult males and characterized by acute or subacute bilateral optic atrophy that results in the loss of central vision. In most of the patients with LHON, visual dysfunction is the only manifestation of the disease. The incidence of LHON in Western Europe is 1/30000-1/50000; at least 1 in 14000 males is affected.

            Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (GSD type XI);
            Glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD type 0)
DESCRIPTION Glycogen storage disease (GSD) is an autosomal recessive (all types except IXa and IXd) or X-linked (types IXa and IXd) disorder with symptoms ranging from weakness to growth abnormalities. GSD is caused by a defect in an enzyme gene or a transporter gene involved in glycogen metabolism; types I, VII, and XI for processing of glucose, types II-VI and IX for processing of glycogen, and type 0 for glycogen synthesis. Pompe disease (type II) is a lysosomal storage disease.

            Pyruvate dehydrogenase E3-binding protein deficiency (PDHXD)
DESCRIPTION Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is an autosomal or X-linked recessive disorder caused by deficient enzyme activity in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in deficiency of acetyl CoA and reduced synthesis of acetylcholine. This deficiency in newborns may lead to brain malformations. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) is an enzyme which regulates the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. It has been reported that the mutations in PDP1 result in severe exercise intolerance and mild developmental delay.

NAME        Canavan disease (CD)
DESCRIPTION Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder associated with mutations of the gene encoding aspartoacylase (ASPA). In humans, the CD syndrome is marked by early onset, hydrocephalus, macroencephaly, psychomotor retardation, and spongiform myelin sheath vacuolization with progressive leukodystrophy. The disease is caused by aspartoacylase deficiency resulting in accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. The increased levels of NAA in CD lead to swelling or sponginess of the brain. Two mutations account for about 98% of the alleles of Ashkenazi Jewish patients, in which population the disease is highly prevalent(E285A and Y231X in ASPA protein). Mutations in the ASPA gene in non-Jewish patients are different and more diverse.

NAME        Refsum disease;
            Heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis
DESCRIPTION Refsum disease (RD) is an autosomal recessive sensory motor neuropathy charactarized by retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral neuropathy, anosmia, deafness, cerebellar ataxia and elevated protein concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of an increased number of cells. The age at which symptoms first present in RD can be variable although most cases present in adolescence. Because the patients are unable to metabolize phytanic acid derived from exogenous sources, highly raised plasma phytanic acid (PA) level in tissues and body fluids is the hallmark of RD. Mutant forms of phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH) which plays a key role of phytanic acid alpha-oxidation in peroxisomes have been shown to be responsible for some, but not all, cases of Refsum's disease. Peroxisomal PHYH import occurs via PEX7 which is the peroxisomal matrix protein receptor. Though PEX7 has been identified another responsible gene, there still remain a small number of patients in whom no mutations in either of these two genes can be found.

NAME        Cockayne syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive multisystem abnormalities such as postnatal growth deficiency, progressive pigmentary retinopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, dental caries and neurological degeneration. CS has thus been classified as a segmental premature-aging syndrome. CSA caused by mutation in the gene encoding the group 8 excision-repair cross-complementing protein (ERCC8) is early childhood onset in the second year of life, CSB caused by mutation in the ERCC6 gene is late childhood onset with mild symptoms. ERCC8 encodes a Walker domain (WD)-repeat protein involved in the transcription-coupled repair system of the actively transcribed DNA. ERCC6 protein is at the interface of transcription and DNA repair and is involved in transcription-coupled and global genome-DNA repair, as well as in general transcription.

NAME        Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP);
            Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome
DESCRIPTION Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressing degenerative disease belonging to the family of tauophaties caused by abnormalities in the microtubule-associated protein, tau. PSP presents with an atypical parkinsonism characterized by progressive axial rigidity, vertical gaze palsy, dysarthria and dysphagia. Although the majority of cases of progressive supranuclear palsy appear to be sporadic, the scarcity of familial cases may lack of recognition of the variable phenotypic expression of PSP. One in every 100,000 Americans over the age of 60 have PSP and patients are usually middle-aged or elderly, and men are affected more often than women.

NAME        Asthma
DESCRIPTION Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.

ENTRY       H00080                      Disease
NAME        Systemic lupus erythematosus
DESCRIPTION Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components, in association with a diverse array of clinical manifestations. The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.

ENTRY       H00081                      Disease
NAME        Hashimoto's thyroiditis
DESCRIPTION Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of immunocytes that replace the parenchyma and induce thyroid enlargement, which eventually leads to gland fibrosis. Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.

NAME        Graves' disease
DESCRIPTION Grave's disease is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by overstimulation of the thyroid gland with agonistic anti-thyrotropin (TSH) receptor autoantibodies. This overstimulation leads to follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, causing thyroid enlargement, as well as increases in thyroid hormone production and the fraction of triiodothyronine (T3) relative to thyroxine (T4) in thyroid secretion. Thyroid autoimmune diseases are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.

NAME        Allograft rejection
DESCRIPTION Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.

NAME        Graft-versus-host disease
DESCRIPTION Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where immunocompetent donor T cells attack the genetically disparate host cells. GVHD pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. During step 3, the effector phase, activated CTL and NK cells mediate cytotoxicity against target host cells through Fas-Fas ligand interactions and perforin-granzyme B.

ENTRY       H00085                      Disease
NAME        Agammaglobulinemias, including the following six diseases:
            X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, XLA);
            IgM heavy chain gene deletions;
            Ig-alpha defect;
            Autosomal recessive agammaglobulinaemia;
            B cell-linker protein (BLNK) deficiency;
            Leucine-rich repeat-containing 8
DESCRIPTION There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (a) consists of agammaglobulinaemias. Defects in early B cell development are characterized by the onset of recurrent bacterial infections in the first 5 years of life, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, markedly reduced or absent B cells in the peripheral circulation, and (in the bone marrow) a severe block in B cell differentiation before the production of surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells. Mutations in Btk, the gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), account for approximately 85% of affected patients. Approximately half of the remaining patients have mutations in genes encoding components of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) or BCR, including mu heavy chain (IGHM); the signal transduction molecules Ig-alpha (CD79A) and Ig-beta (CD79B); and lambda 5 (IGLL1), which forms the surrogate light chain with Vpre-B. A small number of patients with defects in BLNK, a scaffold protein that assembles signal transduction molecules activated by cross-linking of the BCR, have been reported.

NAME        Hyper IgM syndromes, autosomal recessive type, including the following three diseases:
            Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICD) defect;
            Uracil nucleotide glycoside glycosylase (UNG) defect;
            Immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM type 3
DESCRIPTION There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (b), hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM), represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. Seventy per cent of the cases are X-linked in inheritance, and others are autosomal recessive. In the autosomal recessive hyper IgM syndromes, the problem lies in the nucleotide-editing enzymes AICD or UNG. These enzymes are only present in the germinal center B cells, and defects in either disrupt B-cell development and antibody production. Patients with these syndromes typically have recurrent bacterial infections and often have lymphoid hyperplasia.

NAME        Other humoral immunodeficiencies, including the following three diseases:
            Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies (ICF)-syndrome;
            kappa light-chain deficiency;
            Ig heavy chain gene deletions
DESCRIPTION Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomaly syndrome (ICF syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome associated with mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3B gene (DNMT3B) in 75% of cases. Patients have variable hypogammaglobulinemia but typically have profound reduction or absence of two or more Ig isotypes. This leads to severe immunodeficiency and death due to infection often before adulthood. Deficiencies of B-cell receptors are caused by mutations in the genes that encode immunoglobulin heavy or light chains or their associated signaling molecules, leading to agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (such as gamma1, 2, 3, or 4; alpha1 or 2; and epsilon) cause deficiencies of individual classes or subclasses of immunoglobulins, but circulating B cells are present and overall antibody function is usually normal. Mutations in the kappa light-chain gene result in a population of immunoglobulin molecules with only lambda light chains instead of the usual mixture of kappa and lambda types.

ENTRY       H00088                      Disease
NAME        Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), including the following four diseases:
            Inducible T Cell costimulator (ICOS) defect;
            TACI defect;
            CD19 defect;
            BAFFR defect;
            CD20 defect;
            CD81 defect
DESCRIPTION There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (c) CVID, also called acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, adult-onset hypogammaglobulinemia, or dysgammaglobulinemia, is a heterogeneous group of disorders involving both B-cell and T-cell immune function, the predominant manifestation of which is hypogammaglobulinemia. CVID is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, decreased serum Ig levels, and abnormal antibody responses. The mutated genes that produce the CVID phenotype are known only for a minority of patients, and they are diverse in their influence on immune function. Homozygous mutations in ICOS are clearly the cause of disease. Heterozygous mutations in the TNF receptor family member TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand interactor) can be found in up to 10% of patients with CVID.

ENTRY       H00089                      Disease
NAME        IFN-gamma/IL-12 axis, including the following five diseases:
            IL-12 p40 subunit deficiency;
            IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) beta1 chain deficiency;
            IFN-gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) alpha chain deficiency;
            IFN-gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) beta chain deficiency;
            STAT-1 deficiency
DESCRIPTION The interferon-gamma-interleukin-12 axis is critical for defense against intracellular microbes such as mycobacteria, salmonella, and listeria. Mutations in either chain of the IFN-gammaR lead to severe susceptibility to mycobacteria and are very difficult to treat. Mutations in IL-12p40 or IL-12R beta 1 are milder clinically and can be treated with IFN-gamma because that receptor is still intact. Complete recessive mutations in STAT1 are more severe than any of the others because they affect both IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha signaling.

NAME        NK cell defects, including the following disease:
            CD16 deficiency
DESCRIPTION A patient with a mutation in CD16, also known as FcgRIIIa, has been identified. He was a 3-year-old boy, and suffered from recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth. CD16 is part of the FcgRIII found on NK cells as well as macrophages and some T cells. The receptor allows NK cells to phagocytose organisms or cells coated with IgG in the absence of MHC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). The mutation disrupts NK cell function and is associated with NK cytopenia. The patient also had severe clinical problems after BCG vaccination.

ENTRY       H00091                      Disease
NAME        T-B+Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs), including the following eight diseases:
            X-linked SCID;
            Janus kinase-3 (Jak3) deficiency;
            IL-7 receptor alpha (IL7R alpha) deficiency;
            IL-2 receptor alpha (IL2R alpha) deficiency;
            CD45 deficiency;
            CD3 deficiency;
            Winged Helix Nude (WHN) deficiency;
            Immunodeficiency with thynoma
DESCRIPTION Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. SCIDs with lack of circulating T cells but a normal number of B cells accounts for 30 to 50% of all cases of human SCIDs. The most frequent form of SCID, X-linked SCID (SCID-X1), is caused by mutations in the gamma-chain-encoding gene. Gamma-chain is a common subunit shared by several cytokine receptors. It results in an absence of both mature T lymphocytes and NK lymphocytes. The second most common variant is autosomal recessive and due to mutations of the JAK3 gene. IL-7R alpha gene mutations result in a pure T-cell deficiency. Rare cases of SCID consisting of pure T-cell deficiencies have been attributed to defects in key proteins involved in pre-TCR/TCR signaling. Deficiency in the CD45 phosphatase has been reported in two cases of SCID, while defects in CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon and CD zeta have also been described.

ENTRY       H00092                      Disease
NAME        T-B-Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs), including the following four diseases:
            Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency;
            Recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficiencies;
            Artemis deficiency;
            Reticular dysgenesis
DESCRIPTION Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency accounts for about half of the autosomal recessive forms of SCIDs. It is one of the most severe immunodeficiencies and is associated with severe depletion of B cells, T cells, and NK cells. V(D)J- recombination deficiency caused by defects in recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2 and Artemis (DCLRE1C) leads to a T-B-SCID phenotype that is characterized by an arrest of B- and T-cell maturation at the stage of pro-B and pre-T cells, respectively, whereas natural killer (NK)-cell maturation is not affected. V(D)J recombination generates the diversity of B- and T-cell primary immune repertoires.

ENTRY       H00093                      Disease
NAME        Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs), including the following nine diseases:
            X-linked hyper IgM syndrome;
            X-linked, moderate;
            CD40 deficiency hyper IgM syndrome;
            Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency;
            RAG deficiency with granulomas;
            Omenn syndrome;
            MHC deficiency (HLA-class I);
            MHC deficiency (HLA-class II);
            Zap-70 deficiency;
            Ca2+ channel deficiency;
            p56 Lck deficiency;
            CD8 deficiency
DESCRIPTION The term combined immunodeficiency (CID) is used to distinguish patients with low, but not absent, T-cell function from those with severe CID (SCID) characterized by profound deficiencies of T- and B-cell (and sometimes NK- cell) function. Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID. The genetic lesions responsible for this syndrome do not lie within the MHC-II locus itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors, RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK(B), and CIITA, controlling MHC-II expression. ZAP-70 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Recurrent and opportunistic infections occur within the first year of life. The mutations in genes responsible for CRAC channel function, ORAI1 and STIM1, cause the defect in Ca2+ influx.

ENTRY       H00094                      Disease
NAME        Immunodeficiency associated with DNA repair defects, including the following six diseases:
            Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [DS:H00064];
            Ataxia-talangiectasia-like syndrome;
            Nijmegen syndrome [DS:H01344];
            DNA ligase I deficiency;
            DNA ligase IV deficiency;
            Bloom syndrome [DS:H01346]
DESCRIPTION A number of genetically determined disorders collectively called as the chromosome breakage syndromes or DNA-repair disorders have a characteristic cytogenetic feature, chromosome instability. They are all autosomal recessive, show an increased tendency for chromosomal aberrations and to develop malignancies. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bloom syndrome involves a defect in the BLM helicase, which seems to play a role in restarting DNA replication forks that are blocked at lesions, thereby promoting chromosome stability. A point mutational change in DNA ligase I was identified in a unique immunodeficient individual who suffered recurrent sinopulmonary infection leading to bronchiectasis. A non-inactivating mutational change in DNA ligase IV has also been identified in a leukaemia patient, who was dramatically over-sensitive to radiotherapy.

ENTRY       H00095                      Disease
NAME        Ectodermal dysplasia associated immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), including the following two diseases:
            NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO) defect;
            Inhibitor of kappa-B (I-kappa-B) defect
DESCRIPTION Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) refers to a group of inherited disorders involving absence or dysplasia of the ectodermal appendages. Clinically, it is characterized by absence, abnormality, or deficient function of ectodermal derivatives, including skin, teeth, hair, eccrine glands, or nails. In the hypohidrotic/ anhidrotic form of ED (HED/EDA) the patient has no sweat glands, sparse scalp hair and rare conical teeth. Patients with EDA and immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) present some or all of these features, together with severe infectious diseases. EDA-ID principally affects boys, suggesting X-linked recessive inheritance (XL-EDA-ID). This was confirmed in 2000 and beyond with the identification of disease-causing hypomorphic mutations in NEMO, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes IKK-gamma. A novel autosomal dominant of EDA-ID, recently identified in one child, was found to be caused by a hypermorphic mutation of the gene encoding I{kappa}B{alpha}. Similar to XL-EDA-ID patients, from the age of two months he suffered from multiple and severe infections with several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, leading to chronic bronchopneumonitis and gastroenteritis, with failure to thrive.

ENTRY       H00096                      Disease
NAME        Defects of toll-like receptor signaling, including the following disease:
            Il-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Human interleukin (IL) 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiency is a recently discovered primary immunodeficiency that impairs Toll/IL-1R immunity, except for the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3- and TLR4-interferon (IFN)-a/b pathways. IRAK-4 is a kinase that plays a crucial role downstream of individual TLR and IL-1R receptors and upstream of TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6). Patients with IRAK-4 deficiency thus fail to produce TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-gamma in response to IL-1beta and IL-18, respectively. Their blood cells also fail to produce IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-alpha upon stimulation with known TLR agonists. Despite the broad impairment at the two subsequent levels of onset (TLR) and propagation (IL-1R) of inflammation, the clinical phenotype of IRAK-4 deficiency is relatively mild. Patients present no developmental defect and a restricted spectrum of infectious diseases, mostly caused by pyogenic encapsulated bacteria, principally, but not exclusively Gram-positive.

NAME        Chemokine receptor defect, including the following disease:
            WHIM syndrome
DESCRIPTION WHIM (an acronym for warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis, a form of neutropenia) syndrome is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Affected individuals have mutations that variably truncate the cytoplasmic tail domain of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Leukocytes expressing truncated CXCR4 display enhanced responses to the receptor ligand CXCL12, including chemotaxis, which likely impair their trafficking and contribute to the immunohematologic clinical manifestations of the syndrome.

ENTRY       H00098                      Disease
NAME        Chronic granulomatous disease, including the following four diseases:
            X-linked CGD (gp91 phox CGD);
            p22phox deficiency (p22phox CGD);
            p47phox deficiency (p47phox CGD);
            p67phox deficiency (p67phox CGD)
DESCRIPTION Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by impaired activation of the NADPH oxidase activity in phagocytic cells, resulting in the inability of these cells to generate toxic oxygen radicals and hence to kill catalase-positive bacteria. The NADPH oxidase is composed of four polypeptide subunits and mutations in the corresponding genes (gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox) are responsible for the four different genetic subgroups of CGD. Most cases (65%) involve mutations in gp91phox and are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The remainder are autosomal recessive (AR).

ENTRY       H00099                      Disease
NAME        Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), including the following four diseases:
            Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (I);
            Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (II);
            Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (III);
            LAD with Rac2 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which neutrophils fail to mobilize and migrate to sites of injury. At least three genetically distinct forms of this group of disorders have been described: LAD I, II, and III. Defects in the expression of beta2-integrins and fucose- containing proteins account for LAD-I and LAD-II, respectively. In LAD-III integrin expression by leukocytes is normal, but the integrins fail to generate high avidity for their cognate endothelial-cell ligands. Mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3), a gene that encodes an intracellular protein that interacts with cytoplasmic tails of beta-integrins in hematopoietic cells, is the cause of LAD-III. Dominant-negative mutations resulting in deficiency of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac2), the predominant hematopoeitic-specific Rho GTPase in neutrophils also leads to leukocyte adhesion deficiency.

ENTRY       H00100                      Disease
NAME        Neutropenic disorders, including the following three diseases:
            Kostmann syndrome;
            Cyclic neutropenia;
            X-linked neutropenia/myelodysplasia
DESCRIPTION Neutropenias represent a series of potentially life-threatening disorders characterised by a reduction in circulating neutrophils. Since neutrophils play a major role in host defense against bacteria, neutropenia patients suffer from frequent episodes of opportunistic bacterial infections. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare neutropenia with a bone marrow maturation arrest of granulocytic differentiation. Kostmann syndrome is an autosomal recessive SCN. The characteristic maturation arrest and the lack of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood of patients with Kostmann syndrome can be explained by the deletion of an anti-apoptotic factor (HAX-1) in myeloid cells of these patients. Heterozygous mutations in the protooncogene growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) gene are also associated with SCN. In patients with autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia (CyN), a condition with oscillating neutrophil counts but less severe clinical symptoms, heterozygous mutations in ELA-2/ELANE were discovered. Patients with X-linked severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) have been reported with activating mutations in WASp leading to a constitutively-active form of the protein, and unregulated actin polymerization.

NAME        Other phagocyte defects, including the following eight diseases:
            Chediak-Higashi syndrome;
            Griscelli syndrome, type 1 (GS1);
            Griscelli syndrome, type 2 (GS2);
            Griscelli syndrome, type 3 (GS3);
            beta-actin deficiency;
            Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency;
            Myeloperoxidase deficiency;
            Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency;
            Shwachman syndrome
DESCRIPTION Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial skin and ocular albinism, increased susceptibility to infections, and progressive neuropathy. Clinical reports of CHS have identified mutations throughout the CHS1/LYST gene. Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the myosin VA (GS1), RAB27A (GS2) or melanophilin (GS3) genes. GS is characterized by partial albinism, hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurological deterioration, hypogammaglobulinemia and pancytopenia. Abnormal-beta-actin disease accompanies neutrophil chemotactic dysfunction. Neutrophil specific granule deficiency is a rare disorder of neutrophil function characterized by a lack of neutrophil secondary granule proteins and associated with recurrent bacterial infections. It has been linked to a defect in the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) epsilon. Myeloperoxidase deficiency is the most common inherited disorder of neutrophils. Heterogeneous mutations in the gene encoding myeloperoxidase have been described. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a X-chromosomally transmitted disorder. The most frequent clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency are neonatal jaundice, and acute haemolytic anaemia, which is usually triggered by an exogenous agent. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare autosomal-recessive, multisystem disease characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired hematopoiesis, and leukemia predisposition. The only gene known to be associated with SDS is SBDS, which encodes a ribosome maturation protein.

ENTRY       H00102                      Disease
NAME        Classic complement pathway component defects, including the following eight diseases:
            C1q alpha-chain deficiency;
            C1q beta-chain deficiency;
            C1q gamma-chain deficiency;
            C1r deficiency;
            C1s deficiency;
            C2 deficiency;
            C3 deficiency;
            C4 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Complement disorders account for only 2 percent of all primary immunodeficiency disorders. They result from the disruption of one of the proteins involved in the classic or nonclassic activation pathways of the complement response. Defects in the classic pathway account for the more common type of complement deficiency, and are associated with increased risk to develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and SLE-like diseases. Homozygous C2 deficiency, which is the most frequent hereditary deficiency in complement classical pathway components, is associated with SLE in 10% of the cases. Complete C1q and C4 deficiencies are less frequent but associated with a higher prevalence of SLE.

ENTRY       H00103                      Disease
NAME        Late complement pathway defects, including the following seven diseases:
            C5 deficiency;
            C6 deficiency;
            C7 deficiency;
            C8 alpha-chain deficiency;
            C8 beta-chain deficiency;
            C8 gamma-chain deficiency;
            C9 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Late complement component (the final common pathway C5b-C9 components) deficiencies are all inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In all cases, homozygous recessive patients have greatly reduced levels of the respective complement component. Generally, patients with deficiencies of C5, C6, C7, or C8 are particularly susceptible to systemic infections with Neisseria meningitidies and N. gonorrhoeae. Infections are rarely fulminant but are often recurrent and frequently involve unusual serotypes of the organism.

ENTRY       H00104                      Disease
NAME        Alternative complement pathway component defects, including the following four diseases:
            Factor B deficiency;
            Factor D deficiency;
            Factor H deficiency;
            Properdin deficiency
DESCRIPTION The alternative pathway is antibody independent and relies on native C3 undergoing minimal spontaneous hydrolysis. Hydrolyzed C3 binds factor B. Factor B, when bound to hydrolyzed C3, is cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. Hydrolyzed C3Bb is responsible for a constant low level of C3 cleavage into C3b. If C3b binds to an appropriate surface, factor B will bind with C3b to form C3bBb, a highly efficient C3-cleaving enzyme. This overall series of successive proteolytic steps is enhanced by the serum protein properdin, which stabilizes protein:protein interactions during the process. Factor H is essential in controlling the function of the alternative pathway by inhibiting the formation of and degrading C3bBb. Deficiencies of alternative pathway-specific components are rare, and usually lead to an increased frequency of Neisseria infections.

ENTRY       H00105                      Disease
NAME        Mannose-binding lectin pathway component defects, including the following two diseases:
            Mannose-binding lectin deficiency;
            Mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) 2 deficiency
DESCRIPTION There is an increasing number of clinical studies indicating that deficiency of the lectin pathway has been associated with an increased risk, severity, and frequency of infections but also autoimmune disorders. MBL deficiency is one of the most common human immunodeficiencies and arises primarily from three single point mutations in exon 1 of the MBL-2 gene. These mutations result in a failure to assemble fully functional multimeric protein. Inherited MASP-2 deficiency has been described as the result of a mutation causing the exchange of aspartic acid with a glycine at position 105, a position in the first domain, CUB1, involved in calcium binding. This mutation abolishes the binding to MBL and ficolins, and deprives MASP-2 of functional activity.

ENTRY       H00106                      Disease
NAME        Complement regulatory protein defects, including the following six diseases:
            C1 inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema);
            C4 binding protein alpha deficiency;
            C4 binding protein beta deficiency;
            Factor I deficiency;
            Decay-accelerating factor (CD55) deficiency;
            CD59 deficiency
DESCRIPTION To prevent undesirable complement activation, host tissues express a number of complement regulatory proteins. They include C1 inhibitor (C1-INH, also termed SERPING1), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor I, decay accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and so on. C1-INH (SERPING1) deficiency can be genetic or acquired, and this causes an episodic, local increase in vascular permeability in the subcutaneous and submucosal layers, identified as angioedema (hereditary or acquired). Genetic deficiency of C4BP has only been reported in one individual who developed an illness with similarities to Behcet's syndrome. Heterozygous mutations within the Factor I gene have been recently identified in individuals with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), while homozygous deficiency of Factor I is an unusual feature. Factor I-deficient patients present high susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and meningitis. Kidney impairment and autoimmune disorders have also been observed. Only a single case of CD59 deficiency has been reported and this individual developed a paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria(PNH)-like illness. In contrast, deficiency of DAF is not associated with haemolytic anaemia.

ENTRY       H00107                      Disease
NAME        Other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes, including the following eight diseases:
            Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome;
            DiGeorge syndrome;
            Hyper-IgE syndrome;
            X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome;
            Lymphoproliferative syndrome, EBV-associated, autosomal, 1;
            Immunodeficiency, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked Syndrome (IPEX);
            Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia;
            Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED)
DESCRIPTION Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disease and characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia. Several nonsense and missense mutations as well as deletions and insertions of the WAS gene have been identified in WAS patients. DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS) is a congenital immune disorder characterized by lack of embryonic development or underdevelopment of the thymus and surrounding organs. The DGS is a member of a group of disorders that have in common a chromosome deletion involving 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by atopic dermatitis associated with extremely high serum IgE levels and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria. Dominant-negative mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene result in the classical multisystem form of HIES, whereas a null mutation in the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) gene causes an autosomal recessive HIES associated with viral and mycobacterial infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, with manifestations ranging from fatal infectious mononucleosis to B cell lymphomas and hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as well as in a distinct gene, SLAM-associated protein (SAP/DSP1/SH2D1A) have been identified in patients with XLP. Recently, it has been shown that a homozygous mutation in the SH2 domain of the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) gene is associated with fatal Epstein Barr virus associated lymphoproliferation, with a clinical picture similar to that seen in XLP. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) are examples of dysregulated immunity resulting in a disturbed tolerance and multiple autoimmune phenomena. IPEX is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene, and APECED results from mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH) is due to either the homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the nuclear encoded, non-coding RNA gene RMRP.

ENTRY       H00108                      Disease
NAME        Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes (ALPS), including the following five diseases:
            CD95 (Fas) defect, ALPS type 1a;
            CD95L (Fas ligand) defect, ALPS type 1b;
            Caspase 10 defect, ALPS type 2a;
            Caspase 8 defext, ALPS type 2b;
            Activaing N-Ras defect, N-Ras ALPS
DESCRIPTION Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with clinical features of various autoimmune manifestations that predominantly involve polyclonal accumulation of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes with lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, and expansion of double-negative (DN) T cells in the peripheral blood. Central to the cellular pathogenesis is defective FAS-induced apoptosis, which in turn leads to dysregulation of lymphocyte homeostasis. ALPS caused by heterozygous mutations in the Fas gene (ALPS Type Ia) make up the majority of identified cases. However, other mutations, namely of the FasL gene (ALPS Type Ib) and the caspase 8 and 10 gene (ALPS Type II) are occasionally detected, whereas some patients do not present any known mutations (ALPS-III). Recently, mutations of the NRAS gene have been suggested to cause ALPS Type IV.

ENTRY       H00109                      Disease
NAME        Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHPL), including the following three diseases:
            Perforin deficiency;
            Munc deficiency;
            STX11 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with uncontrolled activation of T cells and macrophages (hemophagocytic activation) that infiltrate into liver, spleen, bone marrow, and CNS. The symptoms include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenia. Homozygous and heterozygous gene mutations of perforin, the major immune cytotoxic protein, were detected with frequency between 15% and 50% of all FHPL patients. UNC13D is the second gene associated with FHPL. The encoded protein (Munc13-4) is important for cytolytic granule exocytosis. Recently a third FHPL associated gene on chromosome 6q24 with mutations in STX11 was identified. The encoded protein, t-SNARE syntaxin 11, also plays a role in intracellular trafficking, but its precise role is not known.

NAME        Cholera
DESCRIPTION Cholera is a clinical-epidemiologic syndrome caused by the infection of O1 and O139 serogroups of Vibrio cholerae, a Gram-negative bacillus with the ability to produce a potent enterotoxin (cholera toxin) responsible for the lethal symptoms of the disease. Serogroup O1 causes over 98% of cases worldwide. In its severe form, it is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea and can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Case-fatality rates as high as 50% can be reduced to less than 1% with proper rehydration. Fluid and electrolyte replacement is the mainstay of treatment of cholera patients; the severe cases require antibiotic treatment to reduce the duration of illness and replacement of fluid intake. The antibiotic therapy currently has faced difficulties due to the rapid emergence and spread of multidrug resistant V. cholerae causing several outbreaks in the globe.

NAME        Typhoid fever
DESCRIPTION Typhoid fever, or enteric fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is a systemic febrile disease and endemic disease in many areas of the world, mainly in developing countries. Typhoid is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated water or food and characterized by a variable incubation period ranging from three days to one month. The symptoms include fever, rash, headache, abdominal complaints, nausea, vomiting and anorexia.

NAME        Salmonellosis
DESCRIPTION Salmonellosis (non-typhoid) is an infectious disease caused by any serotype of bacteria in the genus Salmonella, other than Salmonella that causes typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Salmonellosis is one of the most frequently occurring food-borne diseases worldwide, usually acquired via the food chain. Foods prepared with contaminated raw eggs, egg products, and insufficiently heated poultry meat and pork have been identified as the primary sources of human Salmonella infections. Salmonellosis is characterized by the acute onset of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, and sometimes vomiting. The disease is usually self-limiting, lasting a few days. However, in some cases, more serious complications follow, especially in immunocompromised people, pregnant women, the elderly and children.

NAME        Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type I
DESCRIPTION Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of disorders caused by defects in various genes for N-glycan biosynthesis. CDG type I is defined by mutations in genes encoding enzymes which involves disrupted synthesis of the lipid linked oligosaccharide precursor and its transfer to polypeptide chain of protein, affecting N-glycan assembly in cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. An increasing number of disorders have been discovered, with many subtypes identified. PMM2-CDG is the most common form, with over 800 patients diagnosed mostly in Europe. Almost all type present in infancy. These diseases demonstrate a broad range of clinical manifestation, associated with developmental delay, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, seizures, hepatomegaly, microcephaly, and pericardial effusion.

NAME        Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type II
DESCRIPTION Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of disorders caused by defects in various genes for N-glycan biosynthesis. CDG-II is defined by mutations in genes encoding enzymes in the processing of N-glycans on the glycosylated proteins either late in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi compartments. Multiple subtypes have been identified although the numbers and forms of affected individuals with CDG-I are still much more. In contrast to type I, the type II patients show a more severe psychomotor retardation, no peripheral neuropathy and a cerebellar hypoplasia. According to the serum transferrin glycoform, a portion of CDG-II can be diagnosed. Distinct from CDG-I,  the serum trisialo- and asialotransferrin are increased in CDG-II.

ENTRY       H00124                      Disease
NAME        GM2 gangliosidoses, including:
            Tay-Sachs disease (type I);
            Sandhoff disease (type II);
            Tay-Sachs disease AB variant
DESCRIPTION GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficiency of beta-hexosaminiase or the noncatalytic GM2 activator in glycosphingolipid catabolism. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons that mainly affects motor and spinocerebellar function. Mutations of the HEXA gene cause deficiency of the beta-hexosaminidase A and result in Tay-Sachs disease. Mutations of the HEXB gene, encoding the beta-subunit, cause deficiency of both enzymes (beta-hexosaminidase A and B), leading to Sandhoff disease. Deficiency of the GM2 activator protein, which mediates the interaction between the water-soluble beta-hexosaminidase A and GM2 ganglioside, causes the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis.

NAME        Fabry disease
DESCRIPTION Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient alpha-galactosidase A activity. Symptoms arise because of accumulation of glycosphingolipids -mainly globotriaosylceramide- in multiple organs. Fabry disease affects almost all organs. The most serious complications involve the kidneys, heart, and central nervous system. In contrast to many X-linked diseases, female heterozygotes cannot be considered merely carriers of the mutation. All of the signs and symptoms found in males with Fabry disease also have been reported in females.

NAME        Gaucher disease
DESCRIPTION Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient beta-glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase) activity or saposin C which is an activator of beta-glucocerebrosidase in sphingolipid metabolism. The enzymatic defects lead to the accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) in lysosomes of affected cells. Despite the fact that Gaucher Disease consists of a phenotype, with varying degrees of severity, it has been sub-divided in three subtypes according to the presence or absence of neurological involvement. The sub-types are Type 1, 2 and 3.

NAME        Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)
DESCRIPTION Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive demyelinating lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ARSA). The enzyme defect results in the accumulation of sulfatide in the central and peripheral nervous systems and extensive white matter damage and loss of both cognitive and motor functions. Mutated PSAP gene resulting in sphingolipid activator protein B deficiency is known to cause MLD variant in which ARSA is normal.

            Niemann-Pick disease type C1;
            Niemann-Pick disease type C2
DESCRIPTION Niemann-Pick disease type C is an autosomal recessive lysosomal lipid storage disorder caused by a defect of NPC1 or NPC2 involved in cholesterol trafficking. The disease is characterized by neurodegeneration starting from early life. While NPC1 is a lysosomal transmembrane protein involved in shuttling of substrates to the Golgi and possibly elsewhere in cells, NPC2 is a soluble lysosomal protein known to bind cholesterol.

            Niemann-Pick disease, type A;
            Niemann-Pick disease, type B
DESCRIPTION Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity, resulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in many organs. ASM plays an important role in normal membrane turnover and is one of the key enzymes responsible for the production of ceramide. Type A NPD is the infantile form characterized by a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative course that leads to early death. Type B NPD is the later-onset form in which patients exhibit little or no neurological symptoms, but may have severe and progressive visceral organ abnormalities, including hepatosplenomegaly and cardiovascular disease. The different clinical presentations of Types A and B NPD are likely due to small differences in the amount of residual, functional ASM activity.

NAME        Mucolipidosis IV
DESCRIPTION Mucolipidosis IV (ML IV) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation and ophthalmologic abnormalities. ML IV is caused by mutations in mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1), a late endosomal/lysosomal ion channel. Cells from patients with MLIV accumulate enlarged vacuolar structures containing phospholipids, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and gangliosides. Accumulation of lipids results from defects in membrane transport along the late endocytic pathway. It was found that MCOLN1 is required for efficient fusion of both late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes.

The enzymatic defect results in inappropriate accumulation of substrates in various organ systems. NAGA deficiency is divided into three types. Type 1 is Schindler disease, characterized by mental retardation, spasticity ,and myoclonus. Type 2, known as Kanzaki disease, is an adult-onset disorder characterized by angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and mild intellectual impairment. Type 3 is an intermediate disorder with mild-to-moderate neurologic manifestations.

            Sialuria, Finnish type / Salla disease (SD);
            Sialuria, French type
DESCRIPTION Salla disease (SD) and infantile sialic acid storage disorder (ISSD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in SLC17A5 gene which codes for the protein sialin. Sialin is lysosomal membrane transporter that exports free sialic acid from lysosomes and deficient of sialin results in excessive lysosomal storage of free sialic acid. ISSD has a severe phenotype with infantile onset, while the SD has a milder phenotype with later onset. Both disorders cause developmental delay, and ISSD is generally fatal in early childhood. The differential diagnosis of free sialic acid storage also includes French type sialuria, a disorder due to mutations in the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (GNE), the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sialic acid.

NAME        Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, including:
            Wolman disease;
            Cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD)
DESCRIPTION Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency is autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders including Wolman disease and Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD). This disease is characterized by massive accumulation of cholesteryl ester and triglycerides. Wolman disease is the infantile form presenting in early infancy with diarrhea, massive hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and calcification of adrenal glands. Without treatment, hepatic failure and death occur within the first year of life. In CESD, hepatomegaly may be the only clinical abnormality, although lipid deposition is widespread. Although hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was the only therapy, in 2015 sebelipase alfa was approved in the US and EU for the treatment of LAL deficiency.

DESCRIPTION Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a group of severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases characterized by intracellular accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in neurons. NCLs share similar symptoms and signs such as retinopathy, epilepsy, and dementia. Previously, the NCLs were classified into different forms on the basis of age of onset as well as clinical and electron microscopic findings. The presently used nomenclature is based on the genetic findings and divides the NCLs into ten forms, CLN1-CLN10.

            X-linked vacuolar cardiomyopathy and myopathy
DESCRIPTION Danon disease is an X-linked disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal-associated membrane protein Lamp2 and resulting in cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and mental retardation. Originally Danon disease was classificatied as a variant of glycogen storage disease II (Pompe disease). However, at present, it is considered that Danon disease is not a glycogen storage disease because the disease is caused by the primary deficiency of a lysosomal membrane protein instead of a glycolytic enzyme and detailed pathological features are different from those of Pompe disease.

NAME        Phenylketonuria (PKU);
            Hyperphenylalaninemia, BH4-deficient
DESCRIPTION Phenylketonuria is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism marked by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), leading to a toxic accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and multiple tissues and potentially to intellectual disability, delayed speech, seizures, and behavior abnormalities. Deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor of PAH, is caused by defects of the enzymes in pterin biosynthesis. Because BH4 is also a cofactor of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase in neurotransmitter synthesis, BH4-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia is characterized by neurotransmitter deficiencies.

DESCRIPTION Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by a defect in the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leading to mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. Currently, there are effective therapies that are in use for MSUD; the dietary therapy and thiamin supplementation. The dietary therapy, which involves feeding patients with a synthetic diet containing reduced BCAA contents.

DESCRIPTION Holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of biotin metabolism that results from holocarboxylase synthetase activity disruption. HLCS deficiency is also called multiple carboxylase deficiency, because deficient HLCS activity results in reduced activity of multiple carboxylases. In humans, four carboxylases are known to be biotinylated by HLCS. They are pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Symptoms of HLCS deficiency include metabolic acidosis, a characteristic organic aciduria, lethargy, hypotonia, convulsions, and dermatitis.

NAME        Hyperprolinemia (HP)
DESCRIPTION Hyperprolinemia is a phenotype present in two distinct, autosomal recessive metabolic disorders caused by defects in the l-proline catabolic pathway. Hyperprolinemia type I (HPI) and type II (HPII) are caused by deficiencies in proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH; also known as ALDH4A1), respectively. Patients with HPI may exhibit an increase in plasma proline level in absence of urinary pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) while those with HPII have elevated levels of P5C and proline in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Some patients have neurological, renal, and/or auditory defects.

DESCRIPTION Erythropoietic protoporphyria is an inborn error of heme biosynthesis porphyrin metabolism caused by deficiency of enzymes of porphyrin metabolism. Porphyrias are divided into erythropoietic and hepatic according to the predominant porphyrin-accumulating tissue. Three different erythropoietic porphyrias (EP) have been described: erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) the most frequent, congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) /Gunther Disease, and the very rare hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). The symptoms include photosensitivity and hemolytic anemia. ALAS deficiency is responsible for X-linked sideroblastic anemia.

            Acatalasemia;
            Takahara's disease;
            Hypocatalasemia
DESCRIPTION Acatalasia is an autosomal recessive peroxisomal disorder caused by deficiency of erythrocyte catalase that metabolizes both hydrogen peroxide and a variety of substrates such as ethanol, methanol, phenol and nitrites. Catalase has an important protective function against the toxic effects of peroxides generated in peroxisomes and removes them with high efficiency. The Japanese, Swiss, and Hungarian types of acatalasemia display differences in biochemical and genetic aspects. Takahara's disease shows progressive oral gangrene and formerly occurred in about half of Japanese acatalasemia patients.

DESCRIPTION Peroxisome biogenesis disorder (PBD) is a group of lethal disorders caused by mutation of peroxisomal biogenesis factor (PEX) genes. PBDs fall into 4 main phenotypic classes; Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), Infantile Refsum disease (IRD), and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1). Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form and results in neurological dysfunction, craniofacial abnormalities, eye abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and chondrodysplasia punctata. The patients of NALD and IRD have similar symptoms, but they survive considerably longer than ZS. NALD is the intermediate form and IRD is the mildest form.

NAME        Mevalonate kinase deficiency;
            Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D;
            Mevalonic aciduria
DESCRIPTION Mevalonate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, which is identified as the cause of two inherited human autoinflammatory disorders: mevalonic aciduria (MVA) and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS). Mevalonate kinase is located at the beginning of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway compromising the biosynthesis of nonsterol isoprenes in addition to cholesterol. Patients of MVA show the symptoms, including dysmorphic features, cataracts, neurologic symptoms. The majority of patients with HIDS experience only recurrent febrile crises, without any neurologic abnormalities or dysmorphic features. Mevalonic kinase activity in HIDS patients is generally in the range of 5-15% of normal as compared to 0-4% in MVA.

NAME        Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, including:
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type I (RCDP1);
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type II (RCDP2);
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type III (RCDP3)
DESCRIPTION Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is a lethal autosomal recessive disease associated with impaired peroxisomes characterized by proximal limb shortening, severely disturbed endochondrial bone formation, and mental retardation. RCDP1 is peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by mutation of peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7(PEX7) genes. RCDP2 and RCDP3 are single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies caused by mutation of GNPAT and AGPS. Both of them are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids localized in peroxisomes.

NAME        Hyperbilirubinemia, including:
            Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type I (CN1);
            Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type II (CN2);
            Gilbert Syndrome;
            Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS);
            Roter syndrome (RS)
DESCRIPTION Gilbert disease and Crigler-Najjar syndromes result in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by deficiency of bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase which is involved in the detoxification of bilirubin by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Gilbert disease is a benign familial disorder characterized by low-grade chronic hyperbilirubinemia, while Crigler-Najjar syndromes are more severe by kernicterus and jaundice. Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS) is caused by mutations in ABCC2, a canalicular bilirubin glucuronide and xenobiotic export pump. Roter syndrome (RS) is caused by mutations in the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes that encode organic anion transporters. In both DJS and RS, mild jaundice begins shortly after birth or in childhood. There are no signs of hemolysis, and routine hematologic and clinical-biochemistry test results are normal, aside from the primarily conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The hepatocyte pigment deposits is typical of DJS. Total urinary excretion of coproporphyrins is greatly increased in RS.

DESCRIPTION Hypophosphataemic rickets, also known as vitamin D resistant rickets, is a group of genetic disorders characterized by defective reabsorption of inorganic phosphorus by the renal tubules resulting in hypophosphatemia and rickets associated with mineralization defect. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) regulates phos- phate reabsorption in the kidney and therefore plays an essential role in phosphate balance in humans. There is a host of defects that ultimately lead to excess FGF23 levels and thereby cause renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemic rickets.

NAME        Cystic fibrosis (CF)
DESCRIPTION Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder of the exocrine glands caused by mutation of CFTR gene which encodes an ABC transporter for salt homeostasis. CF is a common lethal single-gene disorder in Caucasians with an incidence of 1 in 1500 to 1 in 6500, whereas it is rare among Orientals (1:90000). The common clinical features are chronic lung infections, respiratory distress, and pancreatic insufficiency.

            Alpha thalassemia;
            Beta thalassemia;
            Alpha thalassemia, X-linked (ATRX)
DESCRIPTION Thalassemia is the most common hereditary blood disease caused by mutation of genes encoding hemoglobin alpha and beta chains. The anemia that is associated with thalassemia is caused by ineffective erythropoiesis which results from apoptosis of erythroid precursors or hemolysis due to the chain imbalances.

NAME        Sickle cell anemia (SCA)
DESCRIPTION Sickle cell anaemia is a recessive genetic disease caused by a single-point mutation in the beta globin gene in codon 6 (Glu6Val) that specifies one of the chains of haemoglobin. The disease is characterized by a chronic haemolytic anaemia with the sickle cells which show abnormal morphology due to the damage of the membrane skeletons and agglutinate under deoxygenated conditions.

NAME        Bartter syndrome
DESCRIPTION Bartter syndrome(BS) is a heterogeneous rare disease unified by autosomal recessive transmission. BS is characterized by impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle with elevated aldosterone excretion resulting in salt wasting, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. Type 1 and 2 are the neonatal type but genetically, clinically, and biochemically different. Type 4A shows Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. Type 3 is classic Bartter syndrome. Type 5 is characterized by hypocalcemic hypercalciuria with parathyroid hormone suppression.

NAME        Combined proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 3)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 3 RTA is a mixed type that shares the features of both proximal and distal lesions, with impaired proximal bicarbonate reabsorption coupled with an inability to acidify the urine maximally despite severe degrees of systemic acidemia. The condition is due to an inherited deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) caused by a recessive mutation in the CA2 gene on chromosome 8q22.

NAME        Liddle syndrome
DESCRIPTION Liddle syndrome (LS) is a rare form of autosomal dominant hypertension characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, low-renin activity, and suppressed aldosterone secretion. The mutations in the epithelial Na+ channel gene cause failure of the protein endocytosis and accumulation of active channels at the cell surface, leading persistent absorption of Na+ and resulting in large blood volume and high blood pressure.

NAME        Hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 4), including:
            Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I  (PHA1);
            Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (Gordon's syndrome)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy. It is also often seen in a number of tubulointerstitial renal diseases. Finally, a great number of drugs may induce hyperkalemic RTA.

DESCRIPTION The mutations in the CASR gene which expresses in the parathyroid hormone producing chief cells of the parathyroid gland and the cells lining the kidney tubule affect calcium homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in the CASR gene are responsible for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH1) and for neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). FHH1 is caused by homozygous mutations and characterized by benign symptoms with mild hypercalcaemia, whereas NSHPT is caused by homozygous mutations and characterized by more severe ones with severe hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroid bone disease. Gain-of-function mutations are responsible for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) that characterized by seizures in infancy, moderate hypocalcaemia and, absolute hypercalciuria.

NAME        Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN);
            Wermer syndrome;
            Sipple's syndrome
DESCRIPTION Multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN) are autosomal dominant syndrome which is characterized by the occurrence of tumors involving two or more endocrine glands. Four major forms of MEN are recognized, namely MEN1, MEN2A, MEN2B and MEN4. MEN1, which is also referred as Wermer's syndrome, is characterized by parathyroid adenoma, gastrinoma, and pituitary adenoma. Gastrinomas are the most common type, leading to the Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (see H01522). MEN2 are characterized by medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and includes three subtypes: MEN2A (Sipple's syndrome), MEN2B (MEN3) and familial MTC. MEN2A develop MTC in association with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors. MEN2B develop MTC in association with marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, leading to megacolon. MEN4, also referred to as MENX, appears to have signs and symptoms similar to those of type 1. However MEN4 patients have mutations in other genes. The mutations in their responsible genes are found in Each MEN syndrome.

NAME        Congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism (CHNG)
DESCRIPTION Congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism is characterized as resistance to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) causing increased levels of plasma TSH and low levels of thyroid hormone which is essential for early brain development. The neonatal screening can avoid the poor prognosis of hypothyroidism.

NAME        Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD)
DESCRIPTION Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by glucocorticoid deficiency despite high levels of plasma ACTH. Affected individuals typically present within the first few months of life with symptoms related to cortisol deficiency, including recurrent illnesses or infections, hypoglycemia, convulsions, failure to thrive and shock. The disease is life threatening if untreated. Glucocorticoid replacement is the recommended treatment. It has been reported that FGD is caused by mutation of the ACTH receptor (MC2R) and the accessory protein (MRAP).

NAME        Aldosterone synthase deficiency;
            Corticosterone methyloxidase type I deficiency;
            Corticosterone methyloxidase type II deficiency
DESCRIPTION Aldosterone synthase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the final biochemical step of aldosterone biosynthesis, the 18-hydroxylation of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone. This disease is characterized by life-threatening salt-loss, failure to thrive, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia in early infancy. In type I deficiency, aldosterone is undetectable, whereas in type II aldosterone can be low or normal.

ENTRY       H00265                      Disease
NAME        Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), including:
            Familial dysautonomia (FD/HSAN3);
            Riley-Day syndrome (HSAN3);
            Congenital pain insensitivity with anhidrosis (CIPA/HSAN4)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), also known as hereditary sensory neuropathies (HSN), are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of low prevalence. They are caused by neuronal atrophy and degeneration, predominantly affecting peripheral sensory and autonomic neurons. Hallmark features are progressive sensory loss, chronic skin ulcers, and other skin abnormalities. Autonomic features vary between different subgroups. Distal muscle weakness and wasting may be present and is sometimes so prominent that it becomes difficult to distinguish HSAN from Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome [DS:H00264].  Many of the causing genes for autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive HSAN  have been identified. These genes have been shown to play roles in lipid metabolism and the regulation of intracellular vesicular transport, but also a presumptive transcriptional regulator, a nerve growth factor receptor, and a nerve growth factor have been described among the causative genes in HSAN. HSAN1 and CMT2B are clinically identical despite being caused by mutations in different genes.

NAME        Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection
DESCRIPTION Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection is typically contracted through consumption of contaminated food or contact with contaminated water, animal feces or infected animals. EHEC is also referred to as verocytotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC) or Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC). The serotype O157:H7 is first associated with human disease after a multistate outbreak in the United States in 1982 involving contaminated hamburgers. The symptoms of EHEC infection range from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis and can progress to a severe cases called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

DESCRIPTION Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection is a prevalent infectious disease with potentially severe complications. UPEC, the most common etiological agent of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), accounts for >80% of UTI infections worldwide. Once inside the urinary tract, UPEC preferentially colonizes the bladder and causes cystitis, but can also ascend through the ureters into the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis.

NAME        GM1 gangliosidosis
DESCRIPTION GM1-gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient beta-galactosidase activity. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in nervous tissues and a highly variable storage of keratan sulfate and glycopeptides in visceral and skeletal tissues. There are three main clinical variants, infantile (type I), juvenile (type II), and adult (type III), categorized by severity of symptoms and variable residual enzymatic activity of beta-galactosidase.

            Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS);
            Chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) all arise from a missense mutation in the CIAS1 gene that encodes NALP3. These are autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by recurrent inflammatory episodes. The pathogenic mechanism of these syndromes is attributed to increased activation of the NALP3 inflammasome, resulting in aberrantly high production of IL-1beta.

DESCRIPTION Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominantly-inherited disease which is presented with triad of juvenile-onset granulomatous arthritis, uveitis, and skin rashes. Inflammation of the eyes, camptodactyly and lymphaedenopathy are additional feature of the disease. Missense mutations in the NOD region of NOD2 underlie Blau syndrome, augmenting NOD2 activity even in the absence of pathogenic stimuli. Inflammation seen in patients with Blau syndrome might be due to an aberrant activation of NOD2 and constitutive NF-kappaB activation. Blau syndrome usually occurs in children younger than age 4 years.

NAME        Crohn's disease
DESCRIPTION Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation, primarily localized to the terminal ileum. Most patients have involvement of the small intestine, but the other area of gastrointestinal tract may also be affected. In Western populations, over 50% of patients possess NOD2 mutations. Evidence exists that the NOD2 polymorphysms impair NF-kappaB activation and cytokine secretion in response to its ligand. The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is also attributed to intestinal bacteria that may initiate mucosal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals. Additional genes associated with the disease are recently being identified.

NAME        Pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome
DESCRIPTION Pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome is a rare autoimflammatory disease with early onset, developing erosive arthritis. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Patients typically develop cystic acne, abscesses and cutaneous ulcers, including pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesions. PAPA syndrome is caused by gain-of function mutations in PSTPIP1, a protein capable of associating with pyrin. Mutated PSTPIP1 reduces the inhibitory role of pyrin on inflammasome activation and therefore, potenciates the IL-1beta pathway. Elevated TNFalpha levels are also described.

NAME        Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF);
            Familial hereditary periodic fever syndromes
DESCRIPTION Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most prevalent hereditary periodic fever, affecting 0.1% in people of Mediterranean descent. It is also reported throughout the world's populations. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by missense mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes the pyrin protein. Mutations in pyrin may lead to uncontrolled inflammation due to IL-1beta hyperactivation. FMF is characterized by recurrent inflammatory fevers with sterile peritonitis, pleuritis, arthritis, myalgia and erysipelas-like skin lesions. Renal amyloidosis is the most severe complication, leads to renal failure. These symptoms start before 20 years of age in about 90% of cases.

NAME        Recurrent hydatidiform moles (RHM);
            Familial biparental hydatidiform
DESCRIPTION Hydatidiform mole is an abnormal human pregnancy composed of hyperproliferative trophoblast occuring in approximately 1 in every 1500 pregnancies in Europe and North America. This incidence is higher in other areas in the world. Recurrent hydatidiform mole (RHM), the familial cases of the disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder in which molar tissues are diploid and have a biparental contribution to their genome. The molar tissues show abnormal epigenetic marking of maternal imprinted genes. Affected women have biallelic mutations in the NLRP7 gene (NALP7), a gene thought to be involved in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.

NAME        Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS)
DESCRIPTION Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal recessive encephalopathy characterized by basal ganglia and white matter calcification in the presence of chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis, and a raised level of cerebrospinal fluid IFNalpha. There is progressive neurological dysfunction resulting in a failure of development of expected physical and social skills. AGS presents in infancy and is lethal in ~40% of cases. It can be caused by mutations in the following genes, TREX1, RNaseH2 and SAMHD1 that lead to excessive intracellular accumulation of DNA and abnormal type I IFN metabolism.

DESCRIPTION Familial chilblain lupus (FCL) is a rare, inherited form of cutaneous lupus with prominent skin manifestations in acral parts of the body. Two families with autosomal dominant-inherited chilblain lupus have been reported. First symptoms manifest in early childhood, developing hypergammaglobulinemia and rheumatoid factor antibody production. In FCL, missense mutations in TREX1 that decrease its exonuclease activity were described. The failure of DNA degradation can result in aberrant immune response.

NAME        Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
DESCRIPTION Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myfibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.

NAME        Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
DESCRIPTION Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death.

NAME        Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
DESCRIPTION Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM ("familial" DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of "familial" DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an "idiopathic" DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of "idiopathic" DCM focus on myocarditis induced by enterovirus and subsequent autoimmune myocardium impairments. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with "idiopathic" DCM,  may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2+, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.

NAME        Viral myocarditis
DESCRIPTION Myocarditis is clinically defined as cardiac disease associated with inflammation of the myocardium and necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes in the absence of an ischemic event. Most often, myocarditis results from common viral infections; less commonly, specific forms of myocarditis may result from other pathogens, toxic or hypersensitivity drug reactions, giant-cell myocarditis, or sarcoidosis. More than 20 common viruses, including coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus, have been associated with myocarditis in humans. However, coxsackieviruses are considered the dominant cause of myocarditis, particularly in neonates and young children. After the acute phase caused by direct cytopathic effects of the virus, a small proportion of patients subsequently develop autoimmune- mediated, chronic myocarditis [4], accompanied by circulating autoantibodies to cardiac myosin and other heart antigens, which can sometimes lead to heart failure and death associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Genetic linkage between susceptibility to myocarditis/DCM and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes has been reported in both humans and experimentally induced mouse models.

ENTRY       H00296                      Disease
NAME        Defects in RecQ helicases, including:
            Bloom's syndrome [DS:H01346];
            Werner's syndrome [DS:H01733];
            Rothmund-Thomson syndrome [DS:H01734];
            RAPADILINO syndrome [DS:H00965];
            Baller-Gerold syndrome
DESCRIPTION RecQ helicases have crucial roles in the maintenance of genome stability. In humans, it is known that deficiencies in three of the five human RecQ helicases cause genetic disorders characterized by cancer predisposition, premature aging and developmental abnormalities. These disorders are Bloom's syndrome (BS), Werner's syndrome (WS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), which are caused by mutations in BLM, WRN and RECQ4, respectively. Despite the apparent structural and biochemical similarities between the BLM, WRN and RECQ4 proteins, the phenotypes of BS, WS and RTS are different, suggesting that each disease pathway is functionally distinct to some extent. BS is characterized by most prominently, a predisposition to all types of cancers. WS is characterized by the premature development of features that resemble aging. RTS is characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities, signs of premature aging, and cancer predisposition, especially to osteosarcomas. Recent research has shown many connections between all three proteins and the regulation of excess HR (Homologous recombination). It was also indicated that BLM is involved in repair of stalled DNA replication forks, and that WRN is required for telomere maintenance. Mutations in RECQL4 also associate with 2 additional syndromes, Rapadilino and Baller-Gerold syndrome.

DESCRIPTION Plague is a deadly infectious disease caused by Yersinia pestis. The pathogen has rodent reservoirs and is transmitted to humans usually by fleas as vectors. There are three major manifestations: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plagues. Severe epidemics in the past include the Plague of Justinian in the sixth century, the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and the Third Pandemic that began in Central Asia in the nineteenth century. The genome sequences have been determined for the strains responsible for these epidemics.

NAME        Yersiniosis
DESCRIPTION Yersiniosis (non-plague) is an infectious disease caused by two species, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, which is zoonotic, capable of being transmitted from infected animals to man. Major clinical forms include acute gastroenteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis, which are often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain. Routes of transmission include fecal-oral spread via ingestion of contaminated food as the most common route and consumption of contaminated water supplies. Yersiniosis occurs more commonly in regions with temperate rather than tropical or subtropical climates.

NAME        Shigellosis;
            Bacillary dysentery
DESCRIPTION Shigellosis (bacillary dysentery) is a foodborne enterobacterial infection caused by Shigella species. There are four subgroups of Shigella: S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei. Of these, S. flexneri is the most frequently observed worldwide, and S. dysenteriae causes severe disease with the highest fatality rate. Clinical symptoms include an acute rectocolitis associated with fever, nausea, anorexia, dehydration, mucopurulent and bloody diarrhea, and tenesmus. Transmission usually occurs via contaminated food and water or through person-to-person contact. In humans, shigellosis can be provoked by an extremely small number of organisms (10-100).

NAME        Haemophilus influenzae infection
DESCRIPTION Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections are a major cause of severe infections in children between 2 months and 5 years of age worldwide. It affects approximately 25000 patients each year. Severity of the symptoms of Hib infection depends on the patient's age, and infants between 4 months and 1 year of age are at highest risk for meningitis. Invasive disease due to Hib may produce various clinical syndromes including meningitis, arthritis, pneumonia,	 cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and epiglottitis. Mucosal infections, such as bronchitis, sinusitis and conjunctivitis, and otitis media, can also be caused by Hib, but they are considered to be noninvasive disease.

            Legionnaires disease
DESCRIPTION Legionnaires disease (LD), caused by Gram-negative Legionella spp., can be nosocomial, community acquired or travel related. L. pneumophila is the most common cause of LD. The source of LD is potable water systems that become colonized by the microorganism, transmitted by inhalation of contaminated aerosols and aspiration. Classically, it can cause two different forms of disease in humans: LD, with an incubation period of 2-10 days, which is a multisystem illness that involves the lungs, causing pneumonia, and can cause neurological symptoms, diarrhea and high mortality (up to 50%), and Pontiac fever, with a shorter incubation period of 1-2 days, which is an acute, self-limited, influenza-like disease that does not cause pneumonia. Patients who are at risk for infection include the immunosuppressed, especially those submitted to transplantation (mainly of solid organs), those with chronic lung disease, smokers, and the elderly.

NAME        Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection
DESCRIPTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that may cause severe invasive diseases in critically ill patients. In the 21st century, when the life expectancy of highly susceptible immunocompromised groups has been extended in most countries, P. aeruginosa plays an increasingly prominent role in hospital infections. This organism shows a remarkable capacity to resist antibiotics, either intrinsically (because of constitutive expression of beta-lactamases and efflux pumps, combined with low permeability of the outer-membrane) or following acquisition of resistance genes (e.g., genes for beta-lactamases, or enzymes inactivating aminoglycosides or modifying their target), over-expression of efflux pumps, decreased expression of porins, or mutations in quinolone targets. These mechanisms mediate the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype in P. aeruginosa.

NAME        Pertussis;
            Whooping cough
DESCRIPTION Pertussis, or whooping cough, caused by the gram-negative bacillus Bordetella pertussis, is a highly contagious, acute respiratory disease of humans. Despite high vaccination rates, this illness has re-emerged worldwide, causing approximately 300 000 deaths each year. Waning immunity after childhood immunization has resulted in a growing pool of susceptible adolescents and adults who are capable of transmitting pertussis to vulnerable unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants. The hallmark symptoms of pertussis are paroxysmal coughing with whooping and post-tussive vomiting. Persistent coughing may last for weeks to months with a gradual decrease in frequency and severity. However, it should be noted that B. pertussis infections, particularly in hosts with partial immunity to the bacterium, may also follow a much milder or subclinical course. Complications that are frequently associated with classical pertussis include pneumonia, otitis media, seizures, encephalopathy, and (brain) hemorrhages.

NAME        Helicobacter pylori infection
DESCRIPTION Helicobacter pylori (HP) is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium that specifically colonizes in the gastric epithelium and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastric malignancies. Persistent infection can cause inflammation and gastritis that may lead to carcinogenesis. Transmission is still not entirely clarified, but human-to-human spread through oral-oral or fecal-oral route is thought to be the most plausible. The prevalence of HP infection varies between different geographical regions; generally, the prevalence is about 30% in developed and up to 80% in developing countries. Although HP may sometimes be eradicated by antibiotics given for other infections, infection usually persists life-long unless specific combination antibiotic therapy is taken.

NAME        Trench fever
DESCRIPTION Trench fever is a disease caused by the facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterium Bartonella quintana. It affected several million people worldwide during the two world wars. The incidence of trench fever dramatically decreased after World War II, but recently it reemerged in urban homeless populations of developed countries. The most frequent presentation of trench fever includes repeated cycles of high fever, headache, and dizziness.

NAME        Foodborne Bacillus cereus intoxication
DESCRIPTION Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive aerobic-to-facultatively anaerobic bacterium that causes gastrointestinal infections. The organism produces an emetic or diarrheal syndrome induced by an emetic toxin and enterotoxin, respectively. These infections are frequently associated with the consumption of rice-based dishes. B. cereus is also recognized as an infrequent cause of non-gastrointestinal infections such as ocular infections, septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and surgical and traumatic wound infections.

NAME        Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus (MRSA) infection
DESCRIPTION Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major multidrug-resistant bacteria which have become endemic in the hospital environment, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). Originally limited to the hospital setting, MRSA is a growing cause of infections in the community. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are genetically different from MRSA strains originating in the hospital. Its increase in the community is of concern because CA-MRSA strains appear to be highly virulent, and colonization with CA-MRSA is often undetected in hospitalized patients, which can facilitate its potential for becoming resistant to multiple antibiotics. Health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) is usually associated with pneumonia, urinary tract, blood stream, and surgical wound infections. In contrast, CA-MRSA strains are overwhelmingly associated with skin and soft tissue infections.

NAME        Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus (VRSA) infection
DESCRIPTION Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) represents strains of S. aureus that have ability of resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. S. aureus is the most common cause of nosocomial infections. The glycopeptides-notably vancomycin-have traditionally been the mainstay of treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) but overuse has led to the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VISA and VRSA, respectively). Limited treatment options make resistant S. aureus infections particularly difficult and costly to treat, especially in areas of poor antibiotic penetration, such as joint spaces and the central nervous system. A gene known as vanA is a major determinant, which is transferable and can be acquired by sensitive bacteria from resistant organisms.

DESCRIPTION Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. The characteristic lesion, a vegetation, is composed of a collection of platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, and inflammatory cells. It most commonly involves heart valves but may also occur at the site of a septal defect, on the chordae tendineae, or on the mural endocardium. Staphylococci and streptococci account for 80% of cases of infective endocarditis, with staphylococci currently the most common pathogens. Cerebral complications are the most frequent and most severe extracardiac complications.

NAME        Tetanus
DESCRIPTION Tetanus is a serious, often fatal intoxication caused by infection of Clostridium tetani, a gram-positive bacterium, through cuts or wounds. Mortality rates among untreated patients is high (40%). Tetanus affects the muscles and nerves and manifests as muscle spasms in the jaw (lockjaw). Tetanus can be prevented by getting the tetanus vaccine.

NAME        Botulism
DESCRIPTION Botulism is an acute neuroparalytic illness caused by a botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium. Botulism occurs in four forms: foodborne, wound, infant botulism, and adult intestinal toxemia. Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in symmetrical, descending, and progressive muscle weakness. Delay in treatment may allow progression of paralysis.

DESCRIPTION Mycoplasmas represent the smallest self-replicating organisms that are most closely related to the gram-positive bacterial group that includes streptococci, bacilli, and lactobacilli. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a member of the family Mycoplasmataceae that causes lower respiratory tract infection endemically in most areas of the world. Most infections are mild, but small proportion of infected individuals may develop serious pneumonia due to an enhanced host cellular immune response.

NAME        Tuberculosis
DESCRIPTION Tuberculosis is a infectious disease caused by strains of mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resulting in an estimated two million deaths each year worldwide, more than from any other single bacterial pathogen. Inhalation is the predominant pathway of infection, making pulmonary tuberculosis the most common form of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis may arise either from a recent infection with M. tuberculosis, or from the reactivation of dormant bacilli, years or decades after initial infection. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mainly results from reactivation of a tuberculous focus after hematogenous dissemination or lymphogenous spread from a primary, usually pulmonary focus.

NAME        Diphtheria
DESCRIPTION Diphtheria is a contagious and potentially life-threatening childhood disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. In industrialized countries, immunization against diphtheria became widespread in the 1940s and the incidence of the disease markedly decreased. However, diphtheria still remains endemic in several regions including Africa, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the tropics, and South America. Moreover, a large proportion of adults in industrialized countries are now susceptible to diphtheria because the protection by vaccine does not last for long time unless periodic booster is given.

It has been reported worldwide in all ages and ethnic groups. Pulmonary disease is the most common clinical presentation especially in immunocompromised patients, accounting for more than 40% of reported cases. Nocardiosis also occurs in disseminated form, affecting lungs, central nervous system, skin, and the soft tissues. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis typically affects immunocompetent individuals with traumatic inoculation at the infected site.

NAME        Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA);
            Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
DESCRIPTION Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is caused by repeated inhalation of mainly organic antigens by sensitized subjects. This induces a hypersensitivity response in the distal bronchioles and alveoli and subjects may present clinically with a variety of symptoms. EAA is caused by a wide variety of antigens including bacteria, organic materials, fungal spores, and chemicals. Of the various EAA syndromes, Farmer's lung and Bird fancier's disease are the commonest forms that have been studied. EEA is a complex dynamic clinical syndrome where clinical expression depends on the frequency and amount of contact with antigen and host susceptibility. The manifestations and symptoms can be complicated by self-regulatory measures performed by those affected individuals to reduce antigen exposure. There are many individuals with a positive antibody reaction who remain asymptomatic. EEA traditionally has been described as occurring in a state of acute, subacute, and chronic form.

            Chlamydial urethritis
DESCRIPTION Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the most common sexually transmissible diseases in the world. Most of these infections are asymptomatic but, if not treated, can lead to non-gonococcal urethritis and post-gonococcal urethritis in men. Urethritis can be complicated by acute epididymitis.

Most severe cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted through the bite of female Anopheline mosquitos. In severe malaria, complications such as anaemia, respiratory distress, renal failure, and cerebral malaria are observed in addition to cyclical fevers. There are four species which infect humans; Plasmodium malariae (quartian malaria), Plasmodium vivax (benign tertian malaria), Plasmodium falciparum (malignant tertian malaria) and Plasmodium ovale (ovale tertian malaria).

NAME        Candidiasis
DESCRIPTION Candidiasis is a fungal infection with Candida species, predominantly with Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, causing bloodstream infections. Recently, various non-C. albicans species have emerged as infecting agents. In patients with impaired IL-17 immunity, recurrent or persistent infections are observed (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disease).

DESCRIPTION Cryptococcus is a pathogenic yeast that causes opportunistic infection especially in the immunocompromised patient. It mainly infects the central nervous system and causes meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is responsible for over 600 000 deaths worldwide annually, especially in developing countries. Mortality rate reaches 70% in sub-Saharan Africa. Cryptococcal lung disease is also an important clinical outcome, leading to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure.

NAME        Herpes simplex infection;
            HSV infection
DESCRIPTION Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are responsible for long-term latent infections causing recurrent painful blisters on an erythematous base. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are the usual cause of herpes labialis and herpes genitalis, respectively. However  It is now widely accepted that HSV-1 is an important cause for genital herpes. Infection can also occur in other parts of the body such as the brain (called herpes encephalitis), spinal cord (called herpes meningitis), cornea of the eye (called herpes simplex keratitis) and skin (called eczema herpeticum) if the immune system is severely defective or compromised. HSV spreads through direct contact. Most HSV infection are asymptomatic. However when symptoms do occur, they tend to be more severe with primary compared with recurrent infections. An initial episode of herpes may produce a systemic prodrome of fever and malaise.

            Herpes zoster;
            Shingles
DESCRIPTION Varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus 3) is an almost inevitable human pathogen that has a double-stranded linear DNA genome. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chickenpox) in children, after which the virus establishes latency in sensory neurons. Subsequent reactivation causes herpes zoster (shingles) in adults. Infiltration of the viral vesicles with inflammatory cells leads to pustule formation, which is followed by ulceration and encrustation in both diseases.

DESCRIPTION Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) are members of beta-herpesvirus that are prevalent in the human population. Like all herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 establish latency in the host following primary infection. Primary infection with HHV-6 can either be asymptomatic, cause roseola with high fever and rash, or be associated with an undifferentiated short febrile illness without rash. Primary infection with HHV-7 is milder and most often asymptomatic, although some cases of roseola-like illness have been linked to it.

DESCRIPTION Adenoviruses (Ads) are recognized as etiologic agents of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, eye, kidney, and, more recently, of other organs as a consequence of solid organ and bone marrow transplantations with their associated immunosuppression. Ads are rarely associated with severe clinical symptoms in healthy individuals. In contrast, in the pediatric population, military recruits, and immunocompromised individuals, Ad infections often result in disseminated and potentially life-threatening disease. Ocular Ad infections are among the leading causes of viral conjunctivitis. There is currently no formally approved antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe Ad keratoconjunctivitis and life-threatening Ad infections in immunocompromised patients.

            Variola
DESCRIPTION Smallpox is a contagious disease caused by the variola virus, one of the Orthopoxviruses that causes skin eruption and marked toxemia. There were two distinct clinical varieties of smallpox: variola major with a case fatality rate of 30% and variola minor with milder severity. Smallpox is an old disease that spread throughout the world causing death in millions of people.

NAME        Monkeypox
DESCRIPTION Human monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease caused by Monkeypox virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus. It occurs mostly in the rain forests of central and western Africa. Human monkeypox has a clinical presentation similar to that of smallpox, including characteristic rash. 90% of patients develop lymphadenopathy. By contrast with smallpox, human monkeypox has low transmissibility between human beings.

DESCRIPTION Polioviruses are members of the Enterovirus genus that are transmitted via the hand-to-hand-to-mouth contact. Small proportion of poliovirus infections results in paralytic poliomyelitis due to the viral invasion to central nervous system. The virus destroys lower motor neurons, causing an asymmetric paralysis. The loss of motor neurons is permanent.

NAME        Rabies
DESCRIPTION Rabies is an old zoonotic disease which has been known for more than 4300 years. The common mode of transmission of rabies in man is by bite of the animals already suffering from it. Dogs are the major vectors. Rabies affects the central nervous system and causes fatal encephalomyelitis. WHO estimates that over 30 000 people in Asia and at least 24 000 people in Africa die every year due to rabies.

NAME        B virus infection
DESCRIPTION Macacine herpesvirus 1, also known as B virus, is an alpha-herpesvirus that naturally infects Asiatic macaques. It is transmitted by exposure to contaminated bodily fluids. In macaques, the infection is similar to that of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in humans and serious disease is rare. However, in humans, it invades the central nervous system and causes serious encephalitis with a fatality rate greater than 70%.

DESCRIPTION Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of diseases caused by hantaviruses which are members of family Bunyaviridae. HFRS is characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock and is caused by the serotypes Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Dobrava-Belgrade viruses. The serotype Puumala virus also causes nephropathia epidemica, a milder variant of HFRS.

ENTRY       H00403                      Disease
NAME        Disorders of nucleotide excision repair, including:
            Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP);
            Cockayne syndrome (CS);
            UV-sensitive syndrome (UVS);
            Trichothiodystrophy (TTD);
            Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome (COFS);
            XFE progeroid syndrome
DESCRIPTION Mutations in genes on the nucleotide excision repair pathway are associated with diseases, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). XP is caused by mutations in XPA, ERCC3/XPB, XPC, ERCC2/XPD, DDB2/XPE, ERCC4/XPF, ERCC5/XPG and POLH. XP is classified into eight genetic complementation groups by the present. In this inside, 7groups from the XP-A group to the G group show the abnormality in NER. The symptoms of XP begin in early life. Severe sunburn and blistering occurs in a half of patients, and all show early extensive freckling. Cancer incidence for individuals with XP under 20 years of age is 2,000 times as high as incidence in the general population. Neurodegeneration can be correlated with mutations in specific XP genes (XPA, ERCC3, ERCC2 and ERCC5). Some patients of XP- A develop neurologic symptoms or a more severe clinical phenotype known as de Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome, associated with mutations in the ERCC6 gene. CS is caused by mutations in ERCC8/CSA, ERCC6/CSB. CS is predominantly a developmental and neurological disorder. It results in a severely reduced lifespan but is not linked to an increased incidence of cancer. The three of the XP genes (ERCC2, ERCC3, and ERCC5) are also found to be mutated XP/CS patients (exhibiting both XP and Cockayne's symptoms). ERCC6 is a cause of UV-sensitive syndrome (UVS) which is characterized by photosensitivity and mild freckling but without neurological abnormalities or skin tumors. TTD is a premature aging syndrome, with the hallmark feature of brittle hair and nails, ichthyosis, and progressive mental and physical retardation. Within photo-sensitive TTD, three TFIIH coding genes (ERCC2, ERCC3, and TTDA/GTF2H5) are implicated. Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is rare autosomal recessive disorder with microcephaly, severe mental retardation, and death in childhood. COFS can result from mutations in ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC5 and ERCC6.

DESCRIPTION Since the discovery in 1980s, HIV/AIDS has become the most important infectious disease globally. Many of the clinical features of HIV/AIDS can be ascribed to the profound immune deficiency in patients. HIV infection also increases the risk of autoimmune diseases and malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma.

NAME        Peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme deficiency, including:
            Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) deficiency;
            D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency;
            Perrault syndrome;

            2-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMCR) deficiency;
            Hypercholanemia
DESCRIPTION Peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme deficiency is a group of inherited peroxisomal diseases caused by mutation of one of genes that encode peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system enzymes. The system includes straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1), 2-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR), D-bifunctional protein (DBP) and sterol carrier protein X (SCPx). It is known that some types of fatty acids including very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), branched-chain fatty acid, and the bile acid synthesis intermediates, rely fully on peroxisomes for beta-oxidation. The enzyme defects result in the accumulation of these fatty acids in many organs. The clinical manifestations mimic those of the Zellweger syndrome spectrum. [DS:H00205]

ENTRY       H00408                      Disease
NAME        Type I diabetes mellitus
DESCRIPTION The majority of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) cases are believed to arise from an inflammatory, autoimmune attack against the beta cells in the pancreas, which consequently leads to the failure of insulin-mediated blood glucose regulation in the body. T1DM signs and symptoms can come on quickly and may include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss and so on. It is recognized that both genetic and environmental determinants are important in defining disease risk. The HLA class II genes are most strongly associated with T1DM. Another plausible candidate genes are INS, CTLA4 and PTPN22. The disease may be a result of variations in several susceptibility genes, with the majority only contributing weak effects.

NAME        Type II diabetes mellitus
DESCRIPTION Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance of peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue) and insufficient compensatory insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Both insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are thought to result from the complex interplay of many different pathways under the combined control of environmental and genetic factors. It is accepted that T2DM results from population aging and adverse environmental factors of the modern world which favor the development of obesity.

NAME        Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
DESCRIPTION Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of familial diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset before 25 years of age and primary insulin secretion defects. Mutations in six genes, encoding the glucose sensor enzyme glucokinase and five transcription factors that participate in a regulatory network essential for adult beta cell function, cause most of the MODY cases.

NAME        Hepatitis A;
            Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection
DESCRIPTION Hepatitis A accounts for 20 to 25% of clinically apparent hepatitis cases worldwide. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and in countries with poor sanitary conditions, the population acquires infection in childhood. In these cases, infection causes only minimal illness. In developed countries with good sanitation, people sometimes acquire hepatitis A by travelling to endemic areas, and infection in adults causes severe icteric hepatitis.

NAME        Hepatitis C;

DESCRIPTION Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral disease caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. HCV is a major cause of persistent liver disease, with approximately 170 million individuals infected worldwide. Up to 80% of patients will have chronic infection, 30-40 percent of these patients develop into degenerative liver disease including fibrosis and cirrhosis over 20 years after infection. Some of these patients will develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infections has undergone a huge transformation in recent years. Although interferon-based therapies have been the mainstay of treatment for HCV infection, new interferon-free therapies have recently been approved.

DESCRIPTION Hepatitis E is an infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) that is transmitted through fecal-oral route. The disease is highly endemic in developing countries with poor sanitation and contamination of drinking water. Its case-fatality rates are in the range of 0.5% to 4%. Hepatitis E manifests as acute icteric hepatitis in high-endemicity areas. However, in recent years, cases of hepatitis E have been observed in low-endemicity areas as well, including chronic hepatitis E with higher mortality rate.

DESCRIPTION Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with genetic heterogeneity characterized by defects in multiple organ systems. The main features are retinal degeneration, obesity, hypogonadism, polydactyly, renal dysfunction, and mental retardation. BBS is typified by clinical variability observed both within and between families, which can be explained in part by the presence of second-site modifiers. Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that the BBS phenotype is largely associated with ciliary dysfunction.

NAME        Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL)
DESCRIPTION Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by near total absence of adipose tissue from birth. Several metabolic alterations in carbohydrate (diabetes mellitus) and lipid metabolism and involvement of heart, bone and ovaries are also observed in this disease. Patients typically have low serum levels of leptin and adiponectin. Several genes were studied to identify the molecular alteration responsible for CGL, which have been found to contribute to lipid droplet formation in adipocytes.

ENTRY       H00420                      Disease
NAME        Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL), including the following four diseases:
            Kobberling-type lipodystrophy (FPLD1);
            Dunnigan-type lipodystrophy (FPLD2);
            Dunnigan-like lipodystrophy (FPLD3);
            AKT2 associated lipodystrophy
DESCRIPTION Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable loss of body fat from the extremities as well as from the truncal region. LMNA, PPARG and AKT2 have been identified in association with FPL. However, it is not yet known how these genes cause the disorder. Besides them, additional loci are likely as many FPL patients do not reveal any mutations in these genes. LMNA mutations may affect nuclear function, and may be involved in apoptosis and premature cell death of adipocytes, thus causing lipodystrophy. PPARG and AKT2 are regulators of adipocyte differentiation. AKT2 is also involved in postreceptor insulin signaling. Thus, mutations in these two genes could result in lipodystrophy. The reason why loss of fat is restricted to partial areas remains unknown.

ENTRY       H00421                      Disease
NAME        Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), including:
            Hurler-Scheie syndrome (type1) [DS:H00128];
            Hunter syndrome (type2) [DS:H00129];
            Sanfilippo syndrome (type3) [DS:H00130];
            Morquio syndrome (type4) [DS:H00123];
            Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (type6) [DS:H00131];
            Sly syndrome (type7) [DS:H00132];
            Hyaluronidase deficiency (type9) [DS:H00133]
DESCRIPTION Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficient activity of enzymes that play important roles in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. MPS2/ Hunter syndrome is an X-linked disease and the others are autosomal recessive diseases. The enzyme defects result in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate in many organs, as well as elevated metabolite levels in urine. The MPS diseases share many clinical features that include organomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, decreased growth, and recurrent infections. Most of MPS diseases do not affect the nervous system, and are considered as potentially amenable to enzyme replacement therapy.

NAME        Glycoproteinoses, including:
            Sialidosis/ Mucolipidosis I [DS:H00142];
            Galactosialidosis [DS:H00276];

            Fucosidosis [DS:H00141];
            Schindler/ Kanzaki disease [DS:H00146]
DESCRIPTION Glycoproteinoses is a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficient activty of enzymes that play important roles in the degradation of glycoproteins such as N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides. The lack of a single enzyme leads to the complete blockage of the catabolic chain and results in the accumulation of undegraded oligosaccharides in lysosomes. Glycoproteinoses share many clinical features such as mental retardation, coarse facies, and dysostosis multiplex. Cathepsin A-deficiency causes combined sialidase and beta-galactosidase deficiency (Sialidosis and Galactosialidosis) due to its function in stabilising these two hydrolases.

NAME        Defects in the degradation of sulfatide, including:
            Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) [DS:H00127];
            Krabbe disease/ Globoid cell leukodystrophy [DS:H00135]
DESCRIPTION Defects in the degradation of sulfatide is a group of autosomal recessive demyelinating lysosomal storage diseases including Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe disease. MLD caused by deficiency of lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and Krabbe disease caused by deficiency of galactosylceramidase. The enzyme defects result in the accumulation of sulfatide and galactocerebroside in the central and peripheral nervous systems and extensive white matter damage and loss of both cognitive and motor functions. Mutated PSAP gene resulting in sphingolipid activator proteins (saposin) Saposin B deficiency is known to cause MLD variant in which ARSA is normal. It is also known that saposin A and saposin C are able to stimulate the step of galactocerebroside degradation.

NAME        Defects in the degradation of sphingomyelin, including:
            Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), type A/ B [DS:H00137];
            Farber lipogranulomatosis [DS:H00138]
DESCRIPTION Defects in the degradation of sphingomyelin is a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases including Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), type A/B and Farber lipogranulomatosis. NPD caused by deficient acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity, and Farber lipogranulomatosis is caused by acid ceramidase deficiency, resulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin, ceramide and cholesterol in many organs. ASM and acid ceramidase are key enzymes of the two steps degradation of sphingomyelin and play important roles in normal membrane turnover.

COMMENT     NPD typeA is the infantile form characterized by a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative course that leads to early death. NPD typeB is the later-onset form in which patients exhibit little or no neurological symptoms, but may have severe and progressive visceral organ abnormalities, including hepatosplenomegaly and cardiovascular disease. The different clinical presentations of Types A and B NPD are likely due to small differences in the amount of residual, functional ASM activity.

NAME        Lysosomal cysteine protease deficiencies, including:
            Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) [DS:H00274];
            Pycnodysostosis [DS:H00273]
DESCRIPTION Defects in lysosomal cysteine proteases (Cathepsins) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases. To date only following two human diseases cathepsin deficiencies have been described, though there are eleven lysosomal cystein proteases. Deficiency of cathepsin C leads to Papillon-Lefevre syndrome characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis. Deficiency of cathepsin K leads to pycnodysostosis characterized by osteosclerosis and short stature. Recent findings suggest a more expanded role for cathepsins in human biology.

            (Pycnodysostosis) CTSK; cathepsin K [HSA:1513] [KO:K01371]
COMMENT     In mice, other Cathepsin deficiencies have also been generated. Deficiency of cathepsin F causes lysosomal storage defects and late-onset neurological disease. Lacking cathepsin L develop periodic hair loss. Recent findings suggest a more expanded role for cathepsins in human biology. These roles include apoptosis, MHC class II immune responses, prohormone processing, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling important to cardiovascular or bone development. Cathepsins may also lead to accelerated collagen and elastin degradation and cause the diseases such as atherosclerosis.

NAME        Defects in the degradation of ganglioside, including:
            GM1 gangliosidosis [DS:H00281];
            Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidoses type 1) [DS:H00124];
            Sandhoff disease (GM2 gangliosidoses type 2) [DS:H00124];
            Gaucher disease [DS:H00126]
DESCRIPTION Defects in the degradation of ganglioside is a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficient activty of enzymes or their activators that play important roles in the degradation of ganglioside. The lack of a single enzyme leads to the complete blockage of the catabolic chain and results in the accumulation of undegraded substrates such as keratan sulfate, gangliosides, glucosylceramide and glycopeptides in neurons and skeletal tissues. Deficiency of the GM2 activator protein causes the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. And saposin C is an activator of beta-glucocerebrosidase.

NAME        Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 1)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. The distal type of RTA (dRTA) arises when the collecting duct fails to remove excess acid into the urine and is characterized by the inability to lower urine pH maximally (below 5.5) in the face of spontaneous acidemia or after acid loading. Autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of dRTA are caused by mutations in ion transporters of the acid-secreting Type A intercalated cell of the renal collecting duct. These include the AE1 Cl-/HCO3- exchanger of the basolateral membrane and at least two subunits of the apical membrane vacuolar (v)H+-ATPase, the V1 subunit B1 (associated with deafness) and the V0 subunit a4.

DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Proximal RTA (type 2) is caused by an impairment of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules, resulting in low renal bicarbonate threshold. Mutations in the gene SLC4A4, encoding Na+-HCO3- cotransporter (NBC-1), have been found in proximal RTA.

DESCRIPTION Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare disorder that leads to progressive ossification of muscle tissue and connective tissue. This process becomes noticeable in early childhood. Affected individuals harbor missense mutations in the ACVR1A gene that brings about constitutive activation of BMP type I receptor. FOP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

NAME        Hereditary dentine disorders, including the following three diseases:
            Dentine dysplasia, type II;
            Dentinogenesis imperfecta, types II and III
DESCRIPTION These three disorders comprise a group of autosomal dominant diseases characterized by opalescent teeth caused by abnormal dentine structure. The phenotype varies from mild and severe, affecting either deciduous or both deciduous and permanent dentition. These diseases arise from mutations of the dentine sialophosphoprotein gene (DSPP) that is involved in dentin matrix formation.

NAME        Toxoplasmosis
DESCRIPTION The intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is distributed worldwide among warm-blood animals. In humans, the infection rate is estimated at 10-30 %. Infection is acquired by ingestion of the parasite released by parasitized cats or contained in undercooked meat. The parasite usually causes asymptomatic infection but in immunocompromised indivisuals, it can result in fatal disease with encephalitis. Transmission can also occur vertically. Congenital infection causes spontaneous abortion or serious defects such as hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and intracranial calcification in infants.

            Osteopetrosis, severe neonatal or infantile forms;
            Osteopetrosis, intermediate forms;
            Osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis;

            Osteopetrosis, late-onset form type 2;
            Osteopetrosis, osteoclast poor
DESCRIPTION The osteopetroses are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by increased bone density and the replacement of trabecular bone with compact bone due to reduced osteoclastic bone resorption. Some osteopetrotic conditions exhibit additional clinical features including renal tubular acidosis and secondary neurological impairment. In forms of osteopetrosis with normal osteoclast counts, most of the mutated genes encode proteins that regulate the intra- and extracellular pH of osteoclasts, such as TCIRG1 gene encoding for the a3 subunit of the V-ATPase and ClCN7 gene. In cases with decreased osteoclast counts, osteoclast differentiation is impaired by mutations in RANKL or RANK. These RANK-deficient patients could be rescued by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

DESCRIPTION Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), or Nasu-hakola disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. It is characterized by repeated fractures occurring during adolescence and progressive presenile dementia in the fourth decade. The disease is caused by a mutation in the TREM2 or DAP12 gene that regulates osteoclast differentiation. TREM2-DAP12 is also expressed by microglia, thus neurological impairments seen in this disease are considered to be directly caused by microglial dysfunstion.

NAME        Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis
DESCRIPTION Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OSCS) is a bone dysplasia characterized by longitudinal striations in the metaphyseal region of the long bones and sclerosis of the craniofacial bones. The condition is X-linked dominant. Germline mutations in WTX gene cause OSCS through increased osteoblast activity.

DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and paralysis. The most common form of SMA is caused by mutations of the SMN gene, that encodes the SMN protein, which regulates snRNP assembly. Four types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disease: type I (Werdning-Hoffman), type II (intermediate), type III (Kugeleberg-Welander) and type IV (adult form). Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy are caused by mutation of other genes, some known and others not yet defined.

DESCRIPTION Patella dysplasias are a group of disorders that include aplasia/hypoplasia of patellar. Small patella syndrome is a skeletal dysplasia with anomalies of the pelvis. Ossification of the ischia and inferior pubic rami is also disrupted in patients with small patella syndrome. Nail-patella syndrome is a condition caused by mutation in LMX1B that regulates COL4A4 and COL4A3 expression. The most common associated abnormality is nail dysplasia. Ear-patella-short statute syndrome is characterized by microtia and growth retardation due to delayed skeletal development.

NAME        Fragile X syndrome (FXS)
DESCRIPTION Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a cognitive disorder caused by silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Absence of the associated protein FMRP leads to the dysregulation of many genes creating a phenotype of ADHD, anxiety, epilepsy and autism.There are also several physical features commonly associated with FXS, including elongated faces, prominent ears, and macroorchidism. The most prevalent genetic aberration at the FMR1 locus arises from a noncoding CGG repeat in the 5'untranslated region.

NAME        Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS)
DESCRIPTION Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDSs) are a group of heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders associated with a severe reduction in mitochondrial DNA in the affected tissues. The manifestations vary from tissue-specific mtDNA depletion to wide-spread multisystemic disorders. Some genes are known to underlie this group of disorders, and many disease genes are still unidentified. However, the disease mechanisms seem to be intimately associated with mtDNA replication and nucleotide pool regulation.

NAME        Schneckenbecken dysplasia
DESCRIPTION Schneckenbecken dysplasia is a severe skeletal dysplasia that leads to perinatal death. The characteristic is the snail-like configuration of the hypoplastic iliac bones. Patients also have limbs with extremely short long bones and flat vertebratal bodies. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC35D1 gene impair the transporter activity of nucleotide sugars in Schneckenbecken dysplasia. The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

NAME        Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
DESCRIPTION Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are the most studied genomic-imprinting disorders mapped to chromosome 15q11-q13. Lack of a functional paternal copy of 15q11-q13 causes PWS. Additionally, it has been reported that MECP2 deficiency leads to decreased expression of UBE3A. PWS and AS have characteristic neurologic, developmental, and behavioral phenotypes plus other structural and functional abnormalities. The behavioral and endocrine disorders are more severe in PWS, including obsessive-compulsive symptoms and hypothalamic insufficiency.

NAME        Non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation
DESCRIPTION X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities because of mutations in several genes on the X chromosome. XLMR is subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), depending on whether further abnormalities are found on physical examination, laboratory investigation and brain imaging. The majority of genes that are mutated in NS-XLMR encode proteins are involved in three distinct pathways: Rho GTPases pathway modulating neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity; Rab GTPases pathway regulating synaptic vesicle cycling; gene expression regulation.

            Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD);
            Cone dystrophy (COD);
            Retinal cone dystrophy (RCD)
DESCRIPTION Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) and cone dystrophy (COD) are a subgroup of inherited retinal dystrophies characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptor function. In contrast to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), deterioration of the cone cells is more severe than the rod cells. In CORD, there is a progressive loss of cone photoreceptor function followed by gradual loss of rod photoreceptor function and retinal degeneration. In COD, cone function decreases progressively from its onset, though rod function is well preserved until the late stages of the disease.

NAME        Sclerosteosis
DESCRIPTION Sclerosteosis is a rare sclerosing bone dysplasias inherited in autosomal recessive manner. The main clinical features are enlargement of the jaw and facial bones, which can lead to secondary findings such as facial distortion, increased intracranial pressure often resulting in headaches, and entrapment of the cranial nerves. Other findings include syndactyly and tall stature. This disease is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene, a protein that bind to LRP5/6 and antagonize Wnt signaling. Recently, mutations in the LRP4 gene, coding for a Wnt signaling coreceptor, have been found in patients with sclerosteosis.

NAME        Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM)
DESCRIPTION Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), which is a monogenic form of diabetes, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia in the first 6 months of life. NDM is categorized into transient (TNDM) and permanent (PNDM). In the case of PNDM, the condition does not resolve over time. The most frequent causes of PNDM are heterozygous mutations in the KCNJ11, INS and ABCC8 genes that play a critical role in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. The responsible genes remain unknown in up to 40% of patients.

NAME        Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM)
DESCRIPTION Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), which is a monogenic form of diabetes, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia in the first 6 months of life. NDM is categorized into transient (TNDM) and permanent (PNDM). TNDM is a developmental disorder of insulin production that resolves by age 18 months but can reappear later in life. TNDM is different from type 1 diabetes since no islet cell antibodies or autoimmune phenomenon were found in these patients. 6q24-related TNDM is an imprinting disorder resulting from overexpression of at least two imprinted genes, PLAGL1 and HYMAI, on chromosome 6q24. Hypomethylation of multiple imprinted loci is associated with mutations in ZFP57. Mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1 are other genetic causes of TNDM.

DESCRIPTION Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited progressive retinal diseases characterized by progressive peripheral vision loss and night vision difficulties. RP can be divided into syndromic (40 %) and non-syndromic (60 %) forms. The most frequent forms of syndromic RP are Usher syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in more than 50 genes are known to cause non-syndromic RP. Non-syndromic RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner.

NAME        Venous malformations, including:
            Sporadic venous malformation;
            Cutaneomucosal venous malformation;
            Glomuvenous malformation
DESCRIPTION Venous malformations are vascular anomalies that present with congenital blue-colored birthmarks resulted from dilated veins. Birthmarks in cutaneomucosal venous malformation appear mainly on skin and mucosa, whereas plaques in glomuvenous malformation are located on the extremities, usually nodular and associated with abnormal smooth muscle-like 'glomus cells'. The disease-causing genes are glomulin and TIE2, a receptor for angiogenic factors.

DESCRIPTION Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler's disease, is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia characterized by severe recurrent nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding and cutaneomucosal telangiectases. HHT is often associated with arteriovenous malformations in the pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral, and spinal circulations. The disease arises from defects in TGF-beta signaling.

NAME        Cerebral cavernous malformation
DESCRIPTION Cerebral cavernous malformations are vascular malformations of the central nervous system comprising enlarged caverns with a single layer of endothelium, which easily lead to cerebral hemorrhages. The disease present as either sporadic or autosomal dominant conditions and is linked to three genes KRIT1, MGC4607, and PDCD10. Mutations in KRIT1 impair its interaction with ICAP-1 alpha, a beta 1 integrin binding protein, and influence beta 1 integrin-dependent angiogenesis.

NAME        Atrial septal defect
DESCRIPTION Atrial septal defect is an abnormal hole in the interatrial septum between right and left atria. Atrial septal defect is one of the most frequent types of malformations in congenital heart defect that arise from perturbations of cardiac development during embryogenesis. Multiple transcriptions factors that regulate cardiac development as well as various chemicals and maternal diseases have been implicated in the disease.

NAME        Complete transposition of the great arteries
DESCRIPTION Complete transposition of the great arteries is a congenital heart defect with atrioventricular concordance and ventriculoarterial discordance in which the aorta arises from the morphologic right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the morphologic left ventricle, resulting in severe cyanosis. Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is frequently associated with other cardiac malformations such as ventricular septal defect. TGA is divided into three groups. Group I is TGA with intact ventricular septum. Group II is TGA with ventricular septal defect. Group III is TGA/VSD with pulmonary stenosis.

The most frequent tumors are cerebellar and retinal haemangioblastomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma in the adrenal gland, epididymal cystadenoma, and endolymphatic sac tumours. Germline inactivation of VHL tumor suppressor protein leads to the upregulation of HIF and promotes to carcinogenesis.

It has been confirmed that this disease is associated with some deletions of 2q37. Individuals with BDMR and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) have very similar features. Mutation of the BDMR-causative gene HDAC4 results in reduced expression of RAI1, whose haploinsufficiency leads to SMS.

NAME        Dystrophinopathies, including:
            Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD);
            Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD);
            X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM)
DESCRIPTION Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by weakness of leg, pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles starting in early childhood. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a milder variant of DMD with a better prognosis, with a mean age of onset at 11 years. X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM) is a rare disorder with rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy but almost no skeletal muscle impairment. Absence of the dystrophin protein (DMD) and reduced levels or abnormal configuration of dystrophin (BMD) leads to membrane fragility making muscle cells susceptible to damage from contraction. Secondary increase in free radicals and activation of calcium-dependent proteases are thought to further contribute to muscle degeneration. Recently, heterozygous MYF6 mutation is reported to be associated with BMD.

NAME        Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by the clinical triad of joint contractures that begin in early childhood, slowly progressive muscle weakness and wasting initially in a humeroperoneal distribution that later extends to the scapular and pelvic girdle muscles, and cardiac involvement that usually occurs after the second decade of life. So far, five genes, EMD (emerin), LMNA, SYNE (nesprin)1, SYNE2 and FHL1, have been associated to EDMD phenotypes, that can be inherited following an X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Most of genes known to be associated with EDMD are critical for nuclear envelope integrity.

            Primary ciliary dyskinesia;
            Kartagener syndrome
DESCRIPTION Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with recurrent oto-sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, and infertility owing to impaired motile ciliary function. Alterations in the left-right organization of the internal organ positioning, which is caused by dysfunctional nodal cilia in early developmental stage, occur in approximately 50% of PCD patients and this combination is referred as Kartagener syndrome.

            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2F
DESCRIPTION Sarcoglycanopathies are a group of a four genetically closely related muscular dystrophies with a phenotype often similar to the X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DS:H00562]. It has been demonstrated that pathological mutations of the alpha-sarcoglycan (SG), beta-SG, gamma-SG, and delta-SG genes cause autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies. Clinical presentation of sarcoglycanopathies is characterized by a slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, leading to loss of ambulation during adolescence in most patients.

            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B;
            Distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT)
DESCRIPTION Dysferlinopathies encompass a large variety of neuromuscular diseases characterized by the absence of dysferlin in skeletal muscle and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Dysferlin is a sarcolemmal protein involved in an important role in repairing defects in skeletal membrane. The clinical phenotype is quite variable. Affected individuals usually present with early involvement of the posterior calf muscles, but can present with proximal greater than distal weakness, and less commonly with anterior tibial weakness.

NAME        Caveolinopathies, including:
            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 1C;
            Rippling muscle disease (RMD);
            Idiopathic hyperCKemia;
            Distal myopathy with decreased caveolin 3;
            Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
DESCRIPTION Caveolinopathies are a group of muscle diseases and can lead to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. The same mutation could lead to heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and muscle histopathological changes. They are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Recently, an autosomal recessive inheritance was considered. The clinical findings that may suggest the diagnosis of a caveolinopathy are: onset usually in the first two decades, progressive, proximal, symmetrical muscle weakness, positive Gowers sign, calf hypertrophy, myalgia, cramps, and/or stiffness after exercise, muscle hyperirritability, etc.

NAME        Myotonic dystrophy (DM)
DESCRIPTION Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a complex multisystemic disorder linked to two different genetic loci. DM1 is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK. DM2 is caused by an unstable CCTG repeat in intron 1 of ZNF9. Therefore, both DMs are caused by a repeat expansion in a region transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein. The mutant RNA transcripts aberrantly affect the splicing of the same target RNAs, such as chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) and insulin receptor (INSR), resulting in their shared myotonia and insulin resistance. Affected individuals express highly heterogeneous, multisystemic symptoms including myotonia (muscle hyperexcitability), progressive muscle weakness and wasting, cataract development, testicular atrophy, and cardiac conduction defects. It has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and disease severity generally correlates with repeat length.

NAME        Renal tubular dysgenesis
DESCRIPTION Autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a rare lethal disorder characterized by the absence or incomplete differentiation of proximal tubules. Patients present persistent fetal anuria leading to oligohydramnios sequence. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme or angiotensin II receptor type 1 may cause RTD. These genes are renin-angiotensin system components which regulate renal growth during embryogenesis.

DESCRIPTION X-linked mental retardation (XMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities because of mutations in several genes on the X chromosome. XLMR is subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), depending on whether further abnormalities are found on physical examination, laboratory investigation and brain imaging. Epilepsy is often associated with MR. Although this does not always indicate that the two conditions share the same genetic defects, a genetic correlation between MR and epilepsy has been suggested in some diseases.

NAME        Epstein syndrome;
            Fechtner syndrome
DESCRIPTION Epstein and Fechtner syndromes are rare autosomal dominant progressive nephropathies associated with macrothrombocytopenia. Sensorineural hearing loss can also occur. Fechtner syndrome shows the additional features of cataracts and blue leukocyte inclusion bodies (Doehle-like bodies). Both disorders are linked to mutations in MYH9, the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain. It has been suggested that renoprotective treatment by renin-angiotensin system blockade is effective in reducing proteinuria in patients with MYH9 nephropathy.

NAME        Alport syndrome
DESCRIPTION Alport syndrome is a hereditary hematuric nephropathy with frequent hearing loss and ocular anomalies. Defects of basement membranes arise from mutations in alpha 3, alpha 4, and alpha 5 type IV collagen chains. The mode of inheritance is either X-linked or autosomal recessive, although autosomal dominant form has been observed in a few families. Male patients with X-linked Alport syndrome suffer from severe renal symptoms that progress to end-stage renal disease associated with deafness which starts during the first decade of life, and ocular lesions including anterior lenticonus. Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is usually severe, showing progressive nephritis and hearing impairment.

NAME        Opitz-GBBB syndrome
DESCRIPTION Opitz GBBB syndrome is a pleiotropic genetic disorder characterized by hypertelorism, hypospadias, and additional midline defects. This syndrome was originally described as two distinct entities, the BBB syndrome with cleft lip, palate and mental retardation, and the G-syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal anomalies. Subsequently, both syndromes were merged and reclassified as Opitz GBBB syndrome. There are two forms of Opitz GBBB syndrome, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and patterns of inheritance. The X-linked form is caused by a mutation in the gene MID1 that encodes an ubiquitin ligase that targets phosphatase 2A for degradation. Autosomal dominant form results from a deletion at chromosome 22q11.2.

            Exudative vitreoretinopathy 1 (EVR1);
            Exudative vitreoretinopathy2, X-linked  (EVR2);

            Norrie disease (ND)
DESCRIPTION Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and Norrie disease (ND) are two inherited retinal disorders with highly overlapping ocular manifestations that are caused by alterations in the Wnt signaling network. FEVR and ND share an abnormal vascularization of the peripheral retina with the formation of retinal folds, retinal detachment, and in many cases the creation of a fibrovascular membrane located behind the lens. ND is a severe X-linked recessive form of congenital blindness, which in about one-third of the cases is accompanied by mental retardation and deafness. Mutations in NDP, FZD4, and LRP5 have been reported to be responsible for ophthalmic diseases including ND, FEVR, and osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome. The proteins encoded by these genes have all been shown to participate in the Wnt/Norrin signaling pathway. Recently, heterozygous mutations in TSPAN12, which is a component of the Norrin-FZD4-LRP5 signaling complex, have been found to be responsible for autosomal dominant FEVR.

NAME        Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)
DESCRIPTION Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a usually autosomal dominant inherited form of muscular dystrophy. At disease onset, typically in the second decade of life, FSHD is characterized by initially restricted weakness of shoulder and facial muscles. With progression, the lower extremities, both distal and proximal, become involved. FSHD is caused by a reduction in the copy number of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat. However, the reduction of D4Z4 copy number is not sufficient by itself to cause FSHD. A number of epigenetic events appear to affect the severity of the disease, its rate of progression, and the distribution of muscle weakness.

DESCRIPTION Distal myopathies (MPD) are a group of heterogeneous inherited primary muscle disorders classified into one broad category due to the presentation of weakness involving the distal skeletal muscles. Clinical presentation is characterized by progressive muscular weakness and atrophy beginning in the hands, forearm, lower legs or feet. Currently almost 20 different entities of distal muscular dystrophies have been genetically determined. Half of the genes have been associated with distal phenotypes only, whereas the other genes can manifest also with other than distal phenotypes. Most of the genes code for structural and functional components of the sarcomere. The genes responsible for the pathologically defined category of myofibrillar myopathy are frequently display a distal phenotype.

NAME        Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM), including:
            Desminopathy (MFM1);
            alpha-B Crystallinopathy (MFM2);
            Myotilinopathy (MFM3);
            Zaspopathy (MFM4);
            Filaminopathy (MFM5);
            Bag3opathy
DESCRIPTION Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a group of genetically distinct disorders linked by common morphologic features observed on muscle histology. MFM is characterized by slowly progressive weakness that can involve both proximal and distal muscles. Distal muscle weakness is more pronounced than proximal weakness. All disease proteins identified to date are involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Z-disk. The pathology includes accumulations of these proteins irrespective of primary gene defect, suggesting that these share molecular pathways involved in actin dynamics organized by the Z-disk. Besides accumulations of these proteins, congophilic amyloid products of myofibrillar degradation and ectopic aggregation of dystrophin and gelsolin appear in abnormal myofibers.

            Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV);
            Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM)
DESCRIPTION Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) is an adult onset slowly progressive myopathy secondary to mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene that encodes a bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in sialic acid biosynthesis. DMRV is a myopathy involving distal muscles, although other muscles are likewise involved. The pathological characteristics are the presence of rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers, but are not specific to this myopathy, and the presence of scattered small angular and atrophic fibers.

NAME        46,XX disorders of sex development (Disorders of gonadal development), including:
            Ovotesticular DSD;
            Testicular DSD;
            Ovarian dysgenesis
DESCRIPTION 46,XX disorder of sex development (46,XX DSD) is a condition in which the individual shows ambiguous genitalia with a 46,XX karyotype. One of the categories of 46,XX DSD is disorders of gonadal development, which includes ovotesticular DSD, testicular DSD, and ovarian dysgenesis. Ovotesticular DSD is defined as the simultaneous presence of both testicular and ovarian tissue in the same individual. Approximately 1/3 of the ovotesticular DSD cases have SRY gene, the male-determining factor that is usually located at the Y chromosome. Testicular DSD patients, who have testicular tissue in the absence of an ovarian tissue, are phenotypically normal males. Ovarian dysgenesis is a disorder in which subjects with female phenotype fail to proceed to puberty.

NAME        46,XX disorders of sex development (Disorders related to androgen excess), including:
            Congenital adrenal hyperplasias;
            Glucocorticoid resistance;
            Aromatase deficiency
DESCRIPTION 46,XX disorder of sex development (46,XX DSD) is a condition in which the individual shows ambiguous genitalia with a 46,XX karyotype. Excess androgen during the critical period of sexual differentiation can lead to 46,XX fetus virilization. Congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAH) and other genetic disorders in fetuses impair steroidogenesis, resulting in shunting of cortisol precursors to androgen synthesis and accumulation of the product. Masculinization of female fetuses is described in mothers harboring androgen-producing tumors. Luteoma of pregnancy is the most common source of these maternal-derived androgens.

NAME        Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)
DESCRIPTION Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), also known as familial hypoaldosteronism type I, is an autosomal dominant disease that causes hypertension, hypokalemia, decreased plasma renin activity and increased aldosterone levels. GRA is caused by a chimeric gene that links the 11 [beta]-hydroxylase promoter sequence to the aldosterone synthase gene's coding region. As a result, aldosterone is ectopically synthesized in the cortisol-secreting zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland under the control of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). The high levels of mineralocorticoids activate the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and upregulate Na reabsorption and K secretion. Most individuals have severe hypertension since infancy but milder phenotypes have been described.

NAME        Hypertension exacerbated in pregnancy
DESCRIPTION "Hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy" is a syndrome similar to Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) with autosomal dominant early-onset hypertension. The affected individuals have a gain of function mutation in the human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), resulting in constitutively stimulated Na reabsorption. Hypertension is present in nonpregnant patients and may be severe, but the characteristic feature is marked worsening during pregnancy. The proposed explanation is that the mutation renders the receptor sensitive to nonmineralocorticoid steroids such as progesterone, the level of which rises 100-fold during pregnancy.

NAME        Deafness, autosomal dominant
DESCRIPTION Hereditary deafness is divided into syndromic forms (in which hearing loss is associated with a variety of other anomalies) and non-syndromic forms. Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal-dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. Autosomal-dominant forms of deafness are usually post-lingual and progressive. Dominant mutations may be consistent with initial function and subsequent hearing loss owing to accumulation of pathology.

ENTRY       H00605                      Disease
NAME        Deafness, autosomal recessive
DESCRIPTION Hereditary deafness is divided into syndromic forms (in which hearing loss is associated with a variety of other anomalies) and non-syndromic forms. Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal- dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. The autosomal-recessive forms of deafness are generally the most severe and are almost exclusively caused by cochlear defects (sensorineural deafness), in contrast to the syndromic forms of deafness, where the hearing loss in most cases is conductive (external and/or middle ear developmental defects) or mixed.

ENTRY       H00606                      Disease
NAME        Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy;
            Ohtahara syndrome
DESCRIPTION Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), also known as Ohtahara syndrome,is characterized by frequent tonic spasms of early onset within a few months of life, and a suppression-burst pattern in electroencephalography (EEG). Many causes have been considered for EIEE. It has been reported that 75% of the cases subsequently evolve to West syndrome, and later a much smaller number progress to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

ENTRY       H00607                      Disease
NAME        46,XY disorders of sex development (Disorders of gonadal development), including:
            Gonadal agenesis;
            Complete and partial gonadal dysgenesis;
            Testis regression;
            Ovotesticular DSD
DESCRIPTION 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) caused by impaired gonadal development includes gonadal agenesis, gonadal dysgenesis, testicular regression, and ovotesticular DSD. Absence of testicular determination results in gonadal agenesis/complete dysgenesis characterized by female external and internal genitalia but fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics, whereas incomplete testicular determination cause partial dysgenesis which show ambiguous genitalia. Testicular regression is part of the clinical spectrum of partial 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. These forms of 46,XY DSD have been associated with mutations in several genes, and chromosome mosaicism is now recognized as one of the cause.

ENTRY       H00608                      Disease
NAME        46,XY disorders of sex development (Disorders in androgen synthesis or action), including:
            Congenital adrenal hyperplasias;
            Leydig cell hypoplasia;
            Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
DESCRIPTION 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) can be endocrine-related. Several enzymatic defects that result in insufficient production of testosterone have been reported. These androgen defects and impaired differentiation of Leydig cell, which secretes testosterone, can lead to ambiguous or completely feminized genitalia in 46,XY individuals. Furthermore, defective androgen action due to androgen receptor defects also cause feminization of 46,XY fetuses although they have normal levels of testosterone.

NAME        46,XY disorders of sex development (Other), including:
            Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome;
            Hypospadias;
            Cryptorchidism
DESCRIPTION 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) with other various causes includes persistent Mullerian duct syndrome, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. During embryogenesis, regression of the Mullerian duct is induced by anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in normal 46,XY individuals. In perisitent Mullerian duct syndrome, mutations of the AMH and AMH receptor produce persistence of the uterus and Fallopian tubes in males. Hypospadias is a congenital malformation with ectopic opening of the urethral meatus. Compromised androgen effects can cause this malformation. Cryptorchidism, or undescended testes, is a condition controlled by AMH and insulin-like hormone 3.

NAME        Treacher Collins syndrome
DESCRIPTION Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a rare congenital birth disorder characterized by severe craniofacial defects. Autosomal dominant TCS1 and TCS2 are caused by mutations in the TCOF1 and POLR1D genes, respectively. Autosomal recessive TCS3 is caused by mutations in the POLR1C gene. The majority of TCS cases are caused by a mutation in TCOF1 gene which encodes a putative nucleolar phosphoprotein known as treacle. It has suggested that treacle is involved in the production of ribosomal RNA within cells. POLR1C and POLR1D encode subunits present in RNA polymerase I and III. Both of these polymerases are involved in ribosomal RNA transcription.

NAME        Primary open angle glaucoma
DESCRIPTION Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, and a major cause of irreversible blindness. POAG is often accompanied by ocular hypertension and characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy of the optic nerve, and visual field loss. To date, at least 20 genetic loci for POAG have been reported. And four causative genes (CYP1B1, MYOC, OPTN, and WDR36) are identified from these loci. In addition, recently, heterozygous NTF4 mutation was associated with the phenotype in a small percentage of patients.

NAME        Infantile cortical hyperostosis;
            Caffey disease
DESCRIPTION Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH) is a self-limiting inflammatory disease characterized by swelling of soft tissues and periosteal hyperostosis mainly affecting long bones, mandible, clavicles, and ribs. It usually affects infants less than 6 months of age and spontaneously heals in the first year of life. However severe prenatal form of ICH is lethal in which extensive hyperostosis affects nearly all long bones and the fetus presents with polyhydramnios.

DESCRIPTION Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) and juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) are autosomal recessive diseases with considerable overlapping. Abnormal accumulation of an unidentified hyaline material in body tissues can lead to joint contractures, osteopenia, thickened skin with hyperpigmentation, gingival hypertrophy, and diarrhea in ISH. JHF is a milder form with a later onset.

NAME        Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS)
DESCRIPTION Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severely impaired prenatal and postnatal growth, profound psychomotor retardation. Most patients do not survive beyond the first year of life, as a result of complications associated with reduced mobility and failure to thrive. Recently, a missense mutation in EMG1 was reported to be the cause of BCS. EMG1 is a putative methyltransferase that is required for biogenesis of the 40S subunit of the ribosome.

NAME        Kenny-Caffey syndrome
DESCRIPTION Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) is a rare hereditary bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis with medullary stenosis of long bones with hypocalcemia and ocular abnormalities. Recurrent bacterial infections are common in patients with KCS. KCS is mostly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Autosomal recessive cases have mutations in TBCE gene that encodes chaperone proteins of tubulins.

NAME        Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS)
DESCRIPTION Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder mainly affecting the anterior segment of the eyes congenitally. The ocular features include malformations of aniridia, coloboma of the iris, and ectopic pupils. Open-angle glaucoma can lead to blindness and is the main target of treatment in ARS. Defects in other organ systems, typically the craniofacial, dental, and umbilical abnormalities, are also part of the disorder.

NAME        Alopecia neurologic defects and endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE syndrome)
DESCRIPTION Alopecia neurological defects and endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disease that is clinically heterogeneous. ANE syndrome patients display multiple signs including a varied amount of hair loss, mental retardation, progressive loss of motor ability beginning in the second decade of life, hypogonadism, central adrenal insufficiency, short stature, microcephaly, and several other skeletal and skin abnormalities. The syndrome is caused by decreased expression of the nucleolar protein RBM28, known to be required for biogenesis of the 60S subunit of the ribosome.

NAME        Familial cholestasis, including:
            Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC);
            Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC);
            Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP);
            North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC)
DESCRIPTION Familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive liver disorders characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis, which can be divided in three main groups based on phenotypical differences: progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). PFIC type 1, 2 and 3 are due to mutations in ATP8B1, ABCB11 and ABCB4, respectively. Each of these genes encodes a hepatocanalicular transporter, which is essential for the proper formation of bile. Mutations in ATP8B1 and ABCB11 can also result in the less severe phenotype of BRIC type 1 and 2, respectively, while heterozygous mutations in all three genes are associated with ICP. PFIC type 4 is caused by mutations in HSD3B7,and also known as congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1. North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC) is a distinct, rapidly evolving form of familial cholestasis found in aboriginal children from northwestern Quebec. It has reported that a missense mutation in Cirhin causes NAIC. Cirhin/UTP4 is known to be required for ribosome biogenesis.

DESCRIPTION Tooth agenesis, or hypodontia/origodontia, refers to the congenital absence of a few teeth without any systemic disorders. Tooth development is a complex process that involves interactions between the oral epithelium and an underlying mesenchyme. Perturbation of this process results in tooth agenesis. This disease could be inherited as either an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked trait.

NAME        Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
DESCRIPTION Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most common forms of glomerular disorders leading to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). FSGS is defined as a clinicopathologic syndrome manifesting with high-grade proteinuria, associated with lesions of focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis and foot-process effacement. As the disease progresses, a more diffuse and global pattern of sclerosis evolves. FSGS accounts for 7-20 % of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children and 40 % in adults. There are two types of FSGS, primary (idiopathic) and secondary forms. The specific cause of primary FSGS has been ill-defined. Secondary FSGS is with recognized etiologic associations, including genetic mutations in podocyte-associated proteins, viruses, and drug toxicities. For the initial treatment of FSGS, corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy is recommended.

NAME        Premature ovarian failure
DESCRIPTION Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized by amenorrhea before the age of 40 years with elevated levels of gonadotrophin (LH and FSH) and low levels of gonadal hormones (estrogens and inhibins). The causes of POF can be categorized into genetic and environmental mechanisms. X chromosome defects such as Turner syndrome or trisomy X as well as many genes including BMP15, FMR1, LHR, and FSHR are associated with POF development. For the environmental causes, medical intervention including surgeries and chemotherapies may lead to POF. Autoimmune ovarian failure consists another large category of POF.

NAME        Congenital bile acid synthesis defect (CBAS), including:
            3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency (CBAS1);
            Delta(4)-3-oxosteroid 5-beta-reductase deficiency (CBAS2);
            Oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (CBAS3);
            Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency (CBAS4)
DESCRIPTION Congenital bile acid synthesis defects (CBAS) involve congenital deficiencies in enzymes responsible for catalyzing key reactions in bile acid synthesis. CBAS type 1, 2 ,3  and 4 are due to mutations in HSD3B7, AKR1D1, CYP7B1, and AMACR, respectively. Inherited mutations that impair bile acid synthesis cause a spectrum of human disease ranging from liver failure in early childhood to progressive neuropathy in adults.

NAME        Rheumatoid arthritis
DESCRIPTION Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the "shared epitope" (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.

NAME        Duane retraction syndrome
DESCRIPTION Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital disorder of eye movement that occurs in approximately 1 in 50 patients with strabismus. This condition prevents horizontal eye movement, with absence of outward movement and deficiency of inward movement. Normal ocular motility depends on precise relations between cranial motor neurons and their target, extraocular muscles. In DRS parients, absence of the abducens motor neurons and aberrant innervations of extraocular muscles by third cranial nerve have been reported.

DESCRIPTION Aniridia is a congenital, bilateral ocular malformation defined as iris aplasia or hypoplasia. It can be either isolated or accompanied by other ocular defects. Aniridia is caused by decreased dosage of the PAX6, a master regulatory gene that induces eye formation in a broad range of animals. Recently, it has been reported that aniridia is also caused by heterozygous mutations in the ELP4 gene and TRIM44 gene.

NAME        Ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome)
DESCRIPTION Ectodermal dysplasia with ectrodactyly and macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome) is the rare association of several clinical features caused by defects in CDH3. The ectodermal defect is characterized by hypotrichosis with sparse and short scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Digit deficiency/syndactyly in hands is often more severe than the feet. Bilateral retinal degeneration appears as prominent pigmentation of the retina.

NAME        Barth syndrome (BTHS)
DESCRIPTION Barth syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of infancy characterized by myopathy, cardiomyopathy, cyclic neutropenia, short stature, low cholesterol, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Barth syndrome is due to mutations in the TAZ gene, the exact function of which is unknown but there are indications that it is directly involved in the metabolism of cardiolipin localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

DESCRIPTION McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder including the CNS (chorea, epilepsy), the PNS (axonal polyneuropathy), and the blood cells (acanthocytosis of the erythrocytes) characterized by late onset abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. Mild myopathy is a common manifestation in most cases. Patients often present with mild, asymptomatic hyperCKemia. The absence of the XK membrane transport protein seems to be causative.

NAME        Scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM)
DESCRIPTION Scapuloperoneal syndrome encompasses a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders all characterized by slowly progressive weakness in the shoulder-girdle and peroneal muscles. Both neurogenic and myopathic scapuloperoneal syndromes exist, the latter being referred to as scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM). Distinct subtypes of SPM are caused by mutations in the sarcomeric muscle proteins desmin and myosin heavy chain 7. The X-linked dominant form of SPM (XSPM) is caused by mutations in the FHL1 gene.

NAME        Mandibuloacral dysplasia
DESCRIPTION Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, hypoplasia of the mandible and clavicles, acro-osteolysis, and partial lipodystrophy. Affected individuals have a normal appearance at birth, then progressively develop dysmorphic skeletal features. Mutations in LMNA or ZMPSTE24 are responsible for the disorder.

NAME        Anemia due to disorders of glutathione metabolism, including:
            Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [DS:H01375];
            Glutathione peroxidase deficiency;
            Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency;
            Glutathione synthetase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Anemia due to disorders of glutathione metabolism is a group of red cell disorders caused by inherited abnormality of enzymes of glutathione metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency. A G6PD-deficient patient lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stresses from certain drugs, infections, metabolic conditions, and ingestion of fava beans. GCLC catalyzes the initial and the rate-limiting step of glutathione synthesis. Deficiency of GCLC is extremely rare. GSS deficiency is a more frequent cause of glutathione deficiency.

NAME        Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy;
            Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD)
DESCRIPTION Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HMLs) are disorders involving aberrant myelin formation in the central nervous system. They are clinically characterized by early onset nystagmus, impaired motor development, ataxia, choreoathetoid movements, dysarthria and progressive limb spasticity.  The prototype of primary HMLs is the X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) caused by mutations in PLP1 encoding proteolipid protein lipophilin. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) is clinically similar to classical PMD but is not associated with PLP1 mutations. PMLD appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and mutations have been identified in GJC2, AIMP1, HSPD1 and so on.

NAME        Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome
DESCRIPTION Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) is characterized by a stable sleep schedule with a 4-hour advance than the conventional or desired time. FASPS is associated with mutations in PER2, whose level oscillates with a nearly 24 hour period. Recently, it has been reported that FASPS is also caused by mutations in CSKD1D gene and PER3 gene.

NAME        Nemaline myopathy
DESCRIPTION Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. It is characterized by the presence of rods or nemaline bodies, which are red-purple inclusions in myofibers detected by modified Gomori trichrome technique. The hallmark symptoms are generalized muscle weakness with facial involvement or predominant involvement of proximal limb and respiratory muscles. Currently, NM is classified into six different forms: severe congenital (neonatal) form; Amish NM, intermediate congenital form; typical congenital form; childhood-onset form; and adult-onset (late-onset) form. Mutations in six genes, encoding components of the sarcomeric thin filaments, have been identified. Mutations in ACTA1 and NEB nebulin are the most common.

NAME        Central core disease
DESCRIPTION Central core disease (CCD) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by central cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. CCD is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but recessive inheritance has been recently described in few families. The clinical phenotype of dominantly inherited CCD is variable but usually mild and non-progressive; however, more severe forms including the fetal akinesia syndrome have also been reported associated with recessive or de novo dominant mutations. CCD typically presents in infancy with hypotonia and motor developmental delay and is characterized by predominantly proximal weakness pronounced in the hip girdle. CCD is due to mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, encoding the principal skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (RyR1). Altered excitability and/or changes in calcium homeostasis within muscle cells due to mutation-induced conformational changes of the RyR protein are considered the main pathogenetic mechanisms.

NAME        Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD)
DESCRIPTION Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a relatively rare subtype of congenital myopathy characterized by hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness. Pathologic diagnosis of CFTD is based on the presence of type 1 fiber hypotrophy of at least 12% in the absence of other notable pathological findings, in addition to a clinical presentation typical of congenital myopathies. CFTD is a genetically heterogenous condition with X-linked, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations of the ACTA1 and SEPN1 genes have been identified in a small percentage of CFTD cases, and recently mutations in the TPM3 gene were also found to cause CFTD.

NAME        Cap myopathy
DESCRIPTION Cap myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy morphologically characterized by the presence of cap-like structures which are sharply demarcated structures of disorganized thin filaments in the periphery of muscle fibers. These structures are in fact disarranged myofibrils with enlarged Z discs and no thick filaments. The severity of the disease is related to the number of fibers affected. Therefore, patients may present with a neonatal fatal form or have a more stable course of the disease in the infant non-fatal form. Respiratory problems are common. All the currently recognized genes associated with cap myopathy (TPM2, TPM3 and now ACTA1) encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments.

NAME        Myosin storage myopathy (MSM);
            Hyaline body myopathy
DESCRIPTION Myosin storage myopathy (MSM), also called hyaline body myopathy, is a rare congenital myopathy with variable inheritance characterized by the presence of sub-sarcolemmal hyaline bodies in type I muscle fibers and predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Clinically, patients exhibit variable age of onset ranging from birth through childhood, and occasionally middle age. Symptoms also vary, but typically include slowly progressive muscle hypertonia, scapularperoneal weakness, and respiratory insufficiency. MSM has been associated with 4 missense mutations in the MYH7 gene, which encodes slow/beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MyHC). The disease causing mutations in MYH7 are located in the alpha-helical coiled-coil tail.

DESCRIPTION Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant, late-onset muscle disease associated with progressive ptosis of the eyelids, dysphagia, and unique tubulofilamentous intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in skeletal muscle. OPMD is caused by expansions of the short (GCG) trinucleotide repeat in the coding sequence of the poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. To date OPMD is considered as a primary myopathic disorder and there is little morphologic evidence for neurogenic etiology, though the peripheral nervous system (PNS) seems to be affected in some rare cases.

NAME        Myotonia congenita, including:
            Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsen disease);
            Autosomal recessive myotonia congenita (Becker disease);
            Fluctuating myotonia congenita;
            Myotonia levoir
DESCRIPTION Myotonia congenita is a specific inherited disorder of muscle membrane hyperexcitability caused by reduced sarcolemmal chloride conductance due to mutations in CLCN1, the gene coding for the main skeletal muscle chloride channel ClC-1. Impaired functioning of the ClC-1 leads to an increase in sarcolemmal excitability that clinically presents as delayed muscular relaxation (myotonia). Myotonia congenita may be inherited as either an autosomal dominant (Thomsen disease) or recessive trait (Becker disease). The predominant features of Thomsen disease are a painless, transient, muscle stiffness with a predilection for both the upper extremity and the facial muscles. Compared with Thomsen disease, Becker disease is more common, more insidious, and has initial symptoms that occur later in childhood. Two additional forms of myotonia congenita have been described: myotonia levior and fluctuating myotonia congenita. Like Becker and Thomsen disease, both of these conditions are associated with a defect in the ClC-1. Whether these two entities are truly distinct disorders is under debate, and some propose that they are variants of Thomsen  disease.

            Silver-Russell syndrome
DESCRIPTION Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, relative macrocephaly, a typical triangular face, asymmetry and further less characteristic features. SRS is associated with genetic or epigenetic mutations that affect two different chromosomes. In addition to maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) in 11p15 and maternal duplication of 11p15 have recently been described as major epigenetic disturbances in SRS. The ICR1 regulates expression of the paternally expressed IGF2 and the maternally expressed H19. The H19 gene encodes a 2.3-kb non-coding mRNA, which is strongly expressed during embryogenesis and possibly functions as a microRNA. It has been proposed that H19 hypomethylation leads to biallelic expression of this gene and downregulation of IGF2 expression resulting in growth retardation.

NAME        Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
DESCRIPTION Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by overgrowth, tumor predisposition, and congenital malformations. It is associated with genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in a cluster of imprinted genes found within a genomic region of approximately one megabase on chromosome 11p15. The imprinted region 11p15 is separated into two domains, with each domain regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control regions (ICR). The centromeric ICR2 regulates the expression of CDKN1C, KCNQ1, and further genes. The majority of cases of BWS show hypomethylation in the ICR2 or mutations in the ICR2-regulated CDKN1C gene. In intron 10 of the KCNQ1 locus, the untranslated KCNQ1OT1 RNA is encoded. KCNQ10T1 is expressed by the paternal allele and probably represses realization of the CDKN1C gene. In the telomeric ICR1, hypermethylation of the H19 promoter and loss of imprinting of IGF2 have been reported in a small fraction of patients with BWS. A few BWS cases could be related to NSD1 deletions or mutations.

NAME        Vohwinkel syndrome, including:
            Vohwinkel syndrome (VS);
            Vohwinkel syndrome with ichthyosis
DESCRIPTION Vohwinkel syndrome is a diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma associated with sensorineural deafness. One of the identifiable characteristics of the disorder is the constriction bands of the digits, leading to autoamputation (pseudoainhum). Vohwinkel syndrome is caused by GJB2 mutations, and its variant that is linked to loricrin also has a feature of ichthyosis.

            Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS)
DESCRIPTION Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channels. LQTS is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a propensity to torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia frequently leading to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death usually in young otherwise healthy individuals. Anesthesia in a patient with LQTS can trigger malignant arrhythmias and is therefore a high-risk procedure. There are two well-known syndromes with a long QT interval. The Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by an autosomal-dominant inheritance without familial deafness. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) has an autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance and is associated with deafness.

NAME        Short QT syndrome
DESCRIPTION Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channels. The mutation of genes (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) encoding for cardiac potassium channels plays a central role in SQTS. SQTS is characterized by constantly short QT interval associated with atrial fibrillation, syncopal episodes, and sudden cardiac death. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with a short QT syndrome has an increased risk due to possible T wave oversensing.

NAME        Brugada syndrome (BRS)
DESCRIPTION The Brugada syndrome (BRS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is characterised by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Mutations in eight genes (SCN5A, GPD1L, CACNA1C, CACNB2, SCN1B, KCNE3, SCN3B, and HCN4) are known to cause BRS. In approximately 20% of the cases BRS is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel.

NAME        Sick sinus syndrome (SSS);
            Sinus node dysfunction
DESCRIPTION Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness. SSS has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia. Autosomal recessive type (SSS1) can be caused by compound heterozygous mutation in the SCN5A gene, and autosomal dominant type (SSS2) can be caused by heterozygous mutation in the HCN4. SCN5A encodes an alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel carrying the current to form a rapid upstroke of action potential, whereas HCN4 codes for an alpha-subunit of hyperpolarization-activated cation channel.

DESCRIPTION Atrial fibrillation (AF, ATFB) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is regarded generally as a sporadic, acquired disorder. Nevertheless, recent growing evidence points to an important heritable basis for AF. By linkage analysis, several loci have been mapped for monogenetic AF. Some of these loci encode for subunits of potassium channels.

NAME        Ichthyosis vulgaris
DESCRIPTION Ichthyosis vulgaris is one of the most common genetic keratinization disorder characterized by follicular keratosis and grey scaling on the flexor limbs. It is caused by defective synthesis of filaggrin that leads to reduction of keratohyalin granules in epidermis. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

DESCRIPTION The potassium-aggravated myotonias (PAMs), which are also known as sodium channel myotonias (SCMs), are a group of pure myotonic disorders caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene. PAMs include three diseases with very similar phenotypes: myotonia fluctuans, myotonia permanens, and acetazolamide-sensitive myotonia. These disorders differ from the other nondystrophic myotonias in that: (1) the myotonia is exacerbated by potassium ingestion; (2) the myotonia does not worsen with cold exposure; and (3) there is no major weakness.

NAME        Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP)
DESCRIPTION The periodic paralyses are a group of autosomal-dominant disorders of skeletal muscle sodium, potassium, and calcium channel genes. They are characterized by episodes of muscle weakness associated with variations in serum potassium concentration. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4. However, 20% of cases remain genetically undefined, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. HyperPP is characterized by attacks of flaccid limb paralysis or, rarely, weakness of the eye and throat muscles. Triggers for these attacks include ingestion of potassium-rich food, rest after strenuous exercise, and cold exposure.

NAME        Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP)
DESCRIPTION The periodic paralyses are a group of autosomal-dominant disorders of skeletal muscle sodium, potassium, and calcium channel genes. They are characterized by episodes of muscle weakness associated with variations in serum potassium concentration. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is caused by mutations in both the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4, and the homologous alpha1-subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channel, Cav1.1. HypoPP is associated with point mutations in both CACNA1S (HypoPP1) and SCN4A (HypoPP2); however, approximately 10-20% of cases remain genetically undefined. In general, HypoPP is characterized by reversible attacks of muscle weakness concomitant with decreased blood potassium concentrations. The attacks may be triggered by rest after strenuous exercise, by a meal rich in carbohydrates, or by exposure to cold. Phenotypic differences between HypoPP1 and HypoPP2 include: (1) earlier onset of disease in HypoPP1; (2) myalgias in HypoPP2; (3) on muscle biopsy, predominance of tubular aggregates in HypoPP2 and vacuoles in HypoPP1; and (4) aggravation of HypoPP2 by acetazolamide.

NAME        Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TPP)
DESCRIPTION Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TPP) is characterized by thyrotoxicosis in combination with typical episodes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP). People of Asian descent are most often affected, but all ethnicities can present with TPP. Hypokalemia is typical during paralysis, but is not always detected; administration of potassium during the attacks should be offered cautiously, preferably orally, to prevent rebound hyperkalemia. Mutations have been identified in TPP patients in an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, , that is expressed in muscle and transcriptionally regulated by thyroid hormone. Mutations in Kir2.6, which occur in up to 33% of patients, reinforces the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity in patients with TPP.

NAME        Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)
DESCRIPTION Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a distinct type of periodic paralysis characterized in its full form by a triad of cardiac abnormalities, distinctive facial and skeletal features, and periodic paralysis. The distinctive physical features considered characteristic of ATS are: broad forehead, hypoplastic mandible, hypotelorism, low-set ears, digit clinodactyly, and 2-3 syndactyly of the toes. It is obvious that ATS has a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. ATS patients have loss-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the voltage-gated inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1. However, described KCNJ2 mutations only account for approximately 60% of diagnoses, suggesting genetic heterogeneity.

NAME        Episodic ataxias
DESCRIPTION Episodic ataxias (EAs) are a group of rare autosomal-dominant diseases characterized by recurrent, discrete episodes of ataxia, giddiness, and vertigo. EA1 and EA2 are the most widely recognized of the autosomal-dominant EAs and are caused by dysfunction of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. There are central and peripheral nervous system manifestations in both conditions. The current classification is based on genetics and actually includes seven distinct subtypes. But these variants other than EA1 and EA2 are rare, some only occurring in single families, and gene mutations have not been identified in all. It is quite likely, however, that the number of phenotypes and mutated genes will grow further.

NAME        3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (MGCA)
DESCRIPTION 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (MGCA) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid and 3-methylglutaric acid. Five distinct forms of MGCA have been recognized. MGCA type 1 is caused by primary deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (3-MGCH), resulting in a block of leucine degradation. In all other types, the activities of 3-MGCH and other enzymes of leucine degradation are normal and the MGCA is thought to be secondary to a defect in another pathway. MGCA type 2, also known as Barth syndrome, is an X-linked cardiomyopathy associated with skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth retardation. MGCA type 3, also referred to as Costeff optic atrophy syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene OPA3. It is characterized by early-onset bilateral optic atrophy, later-onset extrapyramidal dysfunction. MGCA type 5 caused by mutation in the DNAJC19 gene, is characterized by early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia, testicular dysgenesis, and growth failure. MGCA type 6 (MEGDEL) caused by mutation in the SERAC1 gene, is characterized by deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like lesions in the basal ganglia. MGCA type 7 (MEGCANN) caused by mutation in the CLPB gene, is characterized by cataracts, neurologic involvement and neutropenia. MGCA type 8 caused by mutation in the HTRA2 gene, is characterized by hypotonia, abnormal movements, respiratory insufficiency with apneic episodes, lack of developmental progress with seizures, and resulting in death in infancy. MGCA type 4 is the unclassified type, which includes all other patients with MGCA.

NAME        Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen disease and Smith-McCort dysplasia
DESCRIPTION Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen (DMC) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association of spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia and mental retardation. The patients have a shortened trunk, striking barrel-shaped thorax, rhizomelic limb shortening, and distal deformities. A clinical entity similar to DMC but without mental retardation is called Smith McCort dysplasia.

NAME        Waardenburg syndrome (WS)
DESCRIPTION Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pigment disturbances of the hair, skin, and iris. Four subtypes of WS have been classified based on the presence or absence of additional symptoms. WS 1 and WS 2 are distinguished by the presence or absence of dystopia canthorum, respectively. WS 3 is similar to WS 1 with additional musculoskeletal abnormalities. WS 4 is characterized by the presence of an aganglionic megacolon. WS is associated with six genes of melanocytic differentiation: PAX3, SOX10, MITF, EDNR, EDN3, and SNAIL2.

NAME        Transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn
DESCRIPTION Transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn is a rare disorder in which subepidermal blistering presents at birth. Tissue separation occurs below the lamina densa, due to abnormal intraepidermal accumulation of type VII collagen. The disease usually regresses during early life, as type VII collagen secretion gradually recovers.

NAME        Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive mental retardation (NS-ARMR)
DESCRIPTION Mental retardation (MR) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low intelligence quotient (IQ) and deficits in adaptive behaviors. Although X-linked MR has been extensively studied, and over 80 causal genes have been cloned, little is known about the genetic basis of nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive mental retardation (NS-ARMR). To date, only a few genes have been identified for NS-ARMR. These include PRSS12, CRBN, CC2D1A, GRIK2, TUSC3, ST3GAL3, TRAPPC9, MAN1B1, PGAP1 and DNST1. These genes have a variety of functions and participate in multiple biochemical pathways. In addition, there are several known disease loci for NS-ARMR for which genes have not yet been identified.

NAME        Hyperekplexia
DESCRIPTION Hyperekplexia, also known as startle disease, is a paroxysmal neurological disorder caused by defects in glycinergic neurotransmission. Hyperekplexia is characterized by neonatal hypertonia and an exaggerated startle reflex in response to acoustic or tactile stimuli. Genetic analysis has revealed mutations in genes for several postsynaptic proteins involved in orchestrating glycinergic neurotransmission, including the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 and beta subunits, gephyrin and collybistin.

NAME        Congenital myasthenic syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogenous group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in several proteins that compose the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) apparatus on which synaptic formation and function depend. The majority are recessively inherited. The disorders of the NMJ cause weakness and fatigue.

NAME        Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM);
            Primary erythromelalgia
DESCRIPTION Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) is characterized by intense episodic burning pain associated with redness and warmth of the affected extremities and in many instances occurs as an autosomal dominant trait. Symptoms of IEM can start as early as 1 year old (early-onset), or in adults (adult-onset), and both types have been described in families and in sporadic cases. Pharmacotherapy has been largely ineffective, and partial relief of symptoms comes from cooling the affected extremities. Dominantly inherited gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, cause IEM.

NAME        Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD)
DESCRIPTION Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD) is a autosomal dominant pain disorder resulting from a set of gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, that impair inactivation of Nav1.7. Severe pain in PEPD patients along with flushing are induced by bowel movement or probing of the perianal areas, and are sometimes accompanied by tonic nonepileptic seizures and cardiac deficits. The pain attacks are most severe in the lower part of the body and are often triggered by temperature changes (such as cold winds), eating, and/or emotional upsets (such as crying).

NAME        Autosomal dominant mental retardation
DESCRIPTION Mental retardation (MR) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low intelligence quotient (IQ) and deficits in adaptive behaviors. Most MR genes identified so far are either located on the X chromosome or are associated with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Only a small number of autosomal dominant MR genes are known, because patients with mental retardation rarely reproduce.

NAME        Nav1.7-associated congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)
DESCRIPTION Nav1.7-associated congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) is a pure form of CIP affecting only pain sensation and olfaction. A loss-of-function of the SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, can produce CIP. Patients with Nav1.7-related CIP present with a history of not ever experiencing any pain even after burns, bone fractures, lip- and tongue-biting, and they do not experience visceral pain. Additionally, patients with Nav1.7-related CIP do not show apparent sympathetic dysfunction and have a normal axon reflex response to histamine. Homozygous and compound null mutations in SCN9A are predicted to truncate the channel protein, resulting in loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.7 and the complete loss of Nav1.7 current in all of the neurons in which this channel is expressed.

NAME        Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine
DESCRIPTION Sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraines (SHM and FHM) are rare paroxysmal disorders characterized by motor aura and headache. The distinction is based on whether at least one first or second degree relative is also affected, otherwise the diagnostic criteria are similar. The majority of FHM families have a mutation in one of the ion channels CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A. SHM is sometimes caused by a de novo mutation in one of the genes. However, at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder, suggesting that other genes are still to be identified.

NAME        Congenital motor nystagmus (CMN);
            Idiopathic congenital nystagmus (ICN)
DESCRIPTION Nystagmus is an eye movement disorder in which one or both eyes are in constant movement. Nystagmus that occur independent of these known ocular or systemic diseases is referred to as congenital motor nystagmus (CMN) or idiopathic congenital nystagmus (ICN). It can be inherited as an autosomal dominant, an autosomal recessive, or an X-linked trait. At least six genetic loci for CMN have been suggested, including three loci for autosomal dominant CMN, and three loci for X-linked CMN.  A variety of mutations in the FRMD7 gene have been identified in many families with an X-linked recessive pattern. Another mutation associated with X-linked CMN is GPR143.

DESCRIPTION Spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-hand type, or spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-abnormal calcification type is a rare skeletal dysplasia. The key clinical features of this condition include short stature with typical short hands and broad, puffy fingers, a narrow chest, and a characteristic craniofacial appearance. Their long bones are short due to premature epiphyses and irregular metaphyses.

NAME        Usher syndrome (US)
DESCRIPTION Usher syndrome (USH) is a group of autosomal recessively inherited disorders characterized by deafness and vision loss. Three clinical types USH1, USH2, and USH3, are distinguished on the basis of severity of hearing loss and the presence or absence of vestibular dysfunction. USH1 patients are congenitally profoundly deaf, and have vestibular dysfunction as well as prepubertal onset of progressive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). USH2 is characterized by congenital mild hearing impairment with normal vestibular responses. USH3 is characterized by a progressive hearing loss, a variable vestibular dysfunction, and RP. USH shows significant genetic heterogeneity, and at least 11 distinct loci have been identified and genes for 9 of them have been cloned.

DESCRIPTION Febrile seizures (FS), or febrile convulsions (FEB), are acute symptomatic seizures that occur in response to fever and represent the most common form of childhood seizures. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a familial epilepsy syndrome with a spectrum of phenotypes including FS. Severe epilepsy phenotypes such as Dravet syndrome (SMEI) have also been described within GEFS+ families. A significant genetic component exists for susceptibility to FS and GEFS+. Extensive genetic studies have shown that at least ten loci are responsible for FS. Furthermore, mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit genes (SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN1B) and the GABA(A) receptor subunit genes (GABRG2 and GABRD) have been identified in GEFS+.

NAME        Hypotrichosis simplex of scalp
DESCRIPTION Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp (HSS) is a rare autosomal dominant genotrichosis that affects men and women equally. It is characterized by progressing hair loss from the middle of the first decade, culminating in an almost complete loss of scalp hair by the third decade. CDSN, a keratinocyte adhesion glycoprotein is responsible for the disease.

NAME        Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), including:
            CSNB type 1 (CSNB1);
            CSNB type 2 (CSNB2);
            CSNB autosomal dominant (CSNBAD);
            Oguchi disease/ CSNB Oguchi type (CSNBO)
DESCRIPTION Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a group of nonprogressive retinal disorders characterized by impaired night vision. CSNB is currently associated with X-linked genes (NYX, CACNA1F), autosomal recessive genes (CABP4, GRK1, GRM6, SAG, TRPM1), and autosomal dominant genes (GNAT1, PDE6B, RHO). Two types of CSNB can be distinguished by use of the standard flash electroretinogram (ERG). CSNB type 1 (CSNB1) is characterized by the complete absence of rod pathway function, whereas CSNB type 2 (CSNB2) is caused by impaired rod and cone pathway function. Oguchi disease is a form of CSNB. Patients with the Oguchi disease have a unique yellowish-gold fundus that regains its normal color after prolonged dark adaptation. That is called the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon.

NAME        Familial carpal tunnel syndrome
DESCRIPTION Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve characterized by paresthesias in the district of the median nerve. Familial carpal tunnel syndrome is an extremely rare form with bilateral symptom that is frequently associated with inherited systemic disorders such as mucopolysaccharidosis, mucolipidosis, amyloidosis, collagen vascular disease or hereditary liability to pressure palsies. The cause of the disease is the compression of the median nerve by thickened transverse carpal ligament. Mutations in transthyretin, a gene that plays a role in deposition of amyloid, have been reported.

            CEDNIK syndrome
DESCRIPTION CEDNIK (Cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratoderma) syndrome is a rare condition that shows severe developmental failure of the nervous system and the epidermis. Clinical manifestations include microcephaly, cerebral dysgenesis, facial dysmorphism, palmoplantar keratoderma, and ichthyosis. Decreased expression of SNAP29, a member of the SNARE family of proteins, is linked to abnormal lamellar granule maturation and abnormal epidermal differentiation.

DESCRIPTION Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arterial aneurysms and dissections, pectus excavatum, craniosynostosis, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, and thin, translucent skin. LDS results from mutations in the TGF beta receptor genes.  LDS has been subdivided in LDS1 and LDS2 on the basis of the presence or the absence of craniofacial involvement, respectively. LDS3 is associated with early-onset osteoarthritis and caused by mutation in the SMAD3 gene. LDS4 is caused by mutation in the TGFB2 gene.

            Aortic aneurysm familial thoracic type (AAT)
DESCRIPTION Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are the major diseases that affect the thoracic aorta. While majority of the cases are sporadic, more than 20% are inherited as a single gene disorder. Familial TAAD is diagnosed based on the presence of dilatation and/or dissection of the thoracic aorta, absence of clinical features of Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and presence of a positive family history of TAAD. TGFBR2, TGFBR1, MYH11, ACTA2, and two loci on other chromosomes, AAT1 and AAT2, are associated with familial TAAD.

DESCRIPTION Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders, characterized by abnormal collagen synthesis, affecting skin, ligaments, joints, blood vessels and other organs. Most EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in genes encoding the fibrillar collagens type I, III and V, or in genes coding for enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of these collagens. EDS can be classified  into six major types: classical type, hypermobility type, vascular type, kyphoscoliosis type, arthrochalasia type and dermatospraxis type. Additional minor variants of EDS have been identified with molecular and biochemical abnormalities: cardiac valvular form, musculocontractural type, progeroid form, tenascin-X deficiency, Brittle cornea syndrome, and EDS-like spondylocheiro dysplasia.

Knobloch syndrome (KNO) may also be caused by mutations in a collagen gene, COL18A1. In addition to Stickler syndrome and other chondrodysplasias, enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) and autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) are associated with vitreoretinal degeneration.

NAME        Benign familial neonatal and infantile epilepsies, including:
            Benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE);
            Benign familial neonatal infantile epilepsy (BFNIE);
            Benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE)
DESCRIPTION Benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), benign familial neonatal infantile epilepsy (BFNIE), and benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE) are three benign epilepsy syndromes with autosomal dominant inheritance distinguished by ascending average ages of seizure onset (mean age at onset of 2-3 days; 11 weeks; and 6 months, respectively). They are a group of genetic (idiopathic) epilepsies which have a primary genetic background, usually no structural brain abnormalities and most of them have a benign course without additional neurological symptoms. For BFNE and BFNIE, genetic defects have already been identified. Whereas BFNE are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the two genes KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encoding the voltage-gated K+ channels Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, mutations in the gene SCN2A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.2 have been detected in BFNIE. There are as yet no known genes identified for BFIE.

            Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by nocturnal, frequent, brief and stereotypic seizures that include explosive onset, screaming, agitation, stiffening, kicking or bicycling of the legs, and incontinence. Ictal video electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed partial seizures originating from the frontal lobe but also in parts of the insula, suggesting a defect of a broader network. Mutations in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and CHRNA2, which encodes the alpha4-, beta2-, and alpha2-subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, have been reported. These mutations are concentrated in the pore-forming M2 transmembrane segments.

            Familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy (FIME)
DESCRIPTION Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are the most common types of epilepsy in childhood and adolescence. Based on the main seizure type and age at onset, four classic subsyndromes exist: childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone. Although autosomal dominant inheritance occurs in rare families, clinical genetic data indicate that complex inheritance involving two or more genes is likely in the majority of families.

NAME        Autosomal dominant temporal lobe epilepsy (ADTLE);
            Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is an inherited epilepsy syndrome characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood of lateral temporal seizures with predominant auditory symptoms originating from the lateral temporal lobe cortex. Mutations in the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene have been reported in up to 50% of ADTLE/ADPEAF pedigrees. In addition, de novo LGI1 mutations are found in about 2% of sporadic cases with idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features, who are clinically similar to the majority of patients with ADLTE/ADPEAF but have no family history.

NAME        Progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME/ EPM), including:
            Lafora disease (LBD);
            Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD);
            Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL);
            Type I sialidosis;
            Action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (DRPLA);
            Type III Gaucher disease (GD)
DESCRIPTION Progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) is a syndrome complex characterized by progressive myoclonus, cognitive impairment, ataxia, and other neurologic deficits. PME is a disease that afflicts previously normal children with ever-worsening and soon-intractable myoclonus and epilepsy, usually associated with neurodegeneration, and eventual dementia and early death. PME include Lafora disease (LBD), Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), type I sialidosis (cherry-red spot myoclonus), action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF/DRPLA), and type III Gaucher disease (GD). Almost all the autosomal recessively inherited PMEs are lysosomal diseases, with the exception of Lafora disease in which neither the accumulating material nor the gene products are in lysosomes. PME also occurs in various forms of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, especially in myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF).

NAME        Distal arthrogryposis (DA)
DESCRIPTION Distal arthrogryposis (DA) are a distinct group of syndromes with congenital contractures primarily involving the hands and feet, which often are associated with abnormal facies, and are transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. To date, 10 different DA syndromes have been characterized and classified. DA2A and DA2B are also referred to as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Sheldon-Hall syndrome, respectively. DA1, DA2A, DA2B, and DA7 are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins of the contractile apparatus of the fast-twitch myofibers including TNNI2, TNNT3, MYH8, MYH3, and TPM2.

DESCRIPTION Stargardt disease (STGD) is the most common type of hereditary macular dystrophy. It is characterized by decreased central vision, atrophy of the macula and underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and frequent presence of prominent flecks in the posterior pole of the retina. Histopathologically, eyes with STGD reveal abnormal accumulations of lipofuscin in the RPE. To date, mutations in four genes have been identified as causing STGD, including ABCA4, ELOVL4, PROM1, and CNGB3.

NAME        Age-related macular degeneration
DESCRIPTION Macular degeneration is the physical breakdown of the central portion of the retina called the macula. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD/ARMD) is the leading cause of blindness. AMD is a complex disease caused by the combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Using genome linkage scan and association studies, multiple potentially causative genes have been identified. In AMD, there are two phenotypes, atrophic/ dry and neovascular/ wet. The former is characterized by the geographic atrophy due to death of retinal pigment epithelium, and the latter is usually characterized by the abnormal growth of new blood vessels under the macula, which causes severe loss of vision. While wet AMD can be treated by the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor or photodynamic therapy, so far there are no available treatments for dry AMD.

DESCRIPTION Renal agenesis and renal adysplasia are congenital defects of kidney development. Renal agenesis can be unilateral/bilateral with no kidneys or very little kidney present. Renal adysplasia is a condition in which kidneys begin to form but contain undifferentiated tissues. Sometimes the hypoplastic tissues regress. These diseases can lead to childhood end-stage renal failure.

NAME        Familial flecked retina syndrome, including:
            Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina (DHRD);
            Basal laminar drusen (BLD);
            Fundus albipunctatus (FA);
            Retinitis punctata albescens (RPA);
            Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy  (BCD)
DESCRIPTION The flecked retina syndrome is characterized by multiple deep, yellow to yellowish white fundus lesions of variable size and shape in eyes without vascular or optic nerve disease. Originally this group consisted of four diseases: fundus albipunctatus, fundus flavimaculatus, familial drusen and fleck retina of Kandori. Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina (DHRD) and Basal laminar drusen (BLD) are included in familial drusen. However, there are far more diseases with fleck-like deposits in the retina, including primary hereditary ocular diseases such as retinitis punctata albescens (RPA) or Bietti's crystalline dystrophy (BCD), neuro-ophthalmologic syndromes such as Kjellin's syndrome, and secundary retinal flecks due to metabolic disorders.

NAME        Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES)
DESCRIPTION Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease. The cardinal feature of this disease is a complex eyelid/ocular malformation such as blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. The horizontal shortening of the palpebral aperture can lead to amblyopia. It is caused by mutations in FOXL2 gene that is involved in palpebral and ovarian development. Some of the female patients have premature ovarian failure (POF) and this condition is classified as BPES type I. BPES with normal ovarian function is referred to as BPES type II.

DESCRIPTION Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of progressive extrapyramidal and cognitive disorders characterized by iron accumulation predominantly in the globus pallidus, as well as extensive axonal spheroids in various regions of the brain. The most frequent genetic form is the pantothenate kinase-2 associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) with a mutation in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene. Other forms are associated with a mutation in phosphoslipase A2 (PLA2G6), FTL (neuroferritinopathy), CP (aceruloplasminemia), FA2H (Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase) and ATP13A2 (ATPase type 13A2) genes. A significant proportion of children with an NBIA phenotype have no genetic diagnosis and there are additional as yet undiscovered genes that account for a number of these cases.

NAME        Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of creatine biosynthesis caused by a deficiency of hepatic guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, resulting in a lack of creatine and an accumulation of guanidinoacetic acid, the precursor of creatine. GAMT deficiency is characterized by developmental arrest or delay in the first few months of life with epilepsy and extrapyramidal movements as common features. Neurologic signs and symptoms are variable, and autistic spectrum disorders are sometimes seen in older affected individuals. Pathophysiology of GAMT deficiency is thought that the accumulation of guanidinoacetate can interact with neuronal GABAA receptors and cause the neurological dysfunction which underlies these symptoms.

DESCRIPTION Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, also known as 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-HBA), is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism. Clinical features include intellectual disability with prominent deficits in expressive language, hypotonia, nonprogressive ataxia, and hyporeflexia. The causative gene is aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A1 (ALDH5A1) encoding SSADH. SSADH is deficient in affected individuals impairing the formation of succinic acid from succinic semialdehyde and leading to the increased production of 4-HBA.

DESCRIPTION GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS) is an autosomal dominant or recessive inborn error of glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier. The majority of patients carry mutations in the SLC2A1 gene encoding the GLUT1 transporter. Defects in the GLUT1 result in low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels termed hypoglycorrhachia. Affected individuals present with mental retardation and learning disabilities; also common are ataxia, dystonia, seizures, and acquired microcephaly.

DESCRIPTION Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a heterogeneous group of severe retinal degenerations, which typically becomes evident in the first year of life. Affected infants have little or no retinal photoreceptor function as tested by electroretinography. LCA is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and caused by mutations in more than a dozen genes. Several have been demonstrated as potentially efficacious gene therapy targets.

In the familial amyloidoses, a gene mutation inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner results in a single amino acid substitution that renders a plasma protein amyloidogenic. Mutations in the TTR gene are the most common cause of familial amyloidosis. The clinical features of familial amyloidosis vary depending on the underlying amyloidogenic protein and the particular amino acid affected by the mutation, ranging from peripheral and autonomic neuropathy to cardiomyopathy.

            Ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2)
DESCRIPTION Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA) is a group of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias mainly characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and choreoathetosis. AOA includes ataxia telangiectasia (AT), ataxia telangiectasia like disorder (ATLD), ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) and ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). AT, ATLD, and AOA1 are due to homozygous mutations in genes encoding a protein involved in DNA repair. Ophthalmic features of AT include conjunctival telangiectasia, strabismus, saccadic dysfunction with head thrusts, and convergence insufficiency. AOA1 is typically characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and late axonal sensori-motor neuropathy. The gene mutated in AOA2, SETX, encodes senataxin, a putative DNA/RNA helicase which has been shown to play a role in the response to oxidative stress.

NAME        Benign hereditary chorea
DESCRIPTION Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) is a rare, autosomal dominant, static disorder characterized by onset of chorea in conjunction with hypothyroidism and respiratory problems. Features supporting this diagnosis include normal general examination with no dysmorphic features, broadly normal intellectual development with no regression or loss of cognitive skills, absence of other significant neurologic disturbances, and, with the exception of chorea, normal neurologic examination findings. Mutations in the TTF1 gene  encoding the thyroid transcription factor-1 have been identified in a number of BHC patients, suggesting that aberration of TTF1 transcriptional function or haploinsufficiency is associated with this disorder. TTF1, belonging to the NKX2 homeodomain transcription factor family, has been implicated in several important molecular pathways essential for brain, thyroid and lung morphogenesis.

NAME        Tourette syndrome
DESCRIPTION Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic motor and vocal tics. Rare functional variants in the neuronal transmembrane molecule SLITRK1 have been associated with TS. The SLITRK1 gene is expressed in brain regions and it appears to play a role in dendritic growth. Another possible rare genetic cause of TS is a mutation in the HDC gene. The HDC gene encodes for L-histidine decarboxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of histamine from histidine.

            Childhood ataxia with diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination (CACH);
            Cree leukoencephalopathy (CLE)
DESCRIPTION Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), also referred to as childhood ataxia with diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination (CACH), is one of the most prevalent inherited childhood disorders of cerebral white matter. This autosomal recessive progressive neurological disorder usually begins in early childhood, but a wide spectrum of clinical severity is now recognized from fatal infantile forms such as Cree leukoencephalopathy to mild later-onset forms associated with ovarian failure. The principal findings are cerebellar ataxia and spasticity with relative preservation of mental abilities. The course is typically relapsing-remitting with progressive neurological deterioration leading to death in the second decade of life. Nearly all patients have mutations in any of the 5 genes encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B. Mutated eIF2B could impair the ability of cells to regulate protein synthesis, especially under conditions of cell stress. Reduced levels of eIF2 activity as occurs in VWM may lead to activation of the unfolded protein response inducing both prosurvival and proapoptotic signals affecting oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in particular.

DESCRIPTION Megalencephaiic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by macrocephaly and a slowly progressive clinical course marked by spasticity and cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral extensive white-matter changes with cysts in the temporal regions. Based on the clinical and MRI features, MLC can be distinguished from other conditions (ie, Alexander disease [DS:H00065], Canavan disease [DS:H00074], glutaric acidemia type I [DS:H00178]) that present in infancy with megalencephaly. An autosomal recessive mutations in the MLC1 gene have been shown to cause this condition. Recently, mutations in HEPACAM gene are reported to be associated with MLC.

DESCRIPTION Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is a condition associated with DNA mismatch repair mutations. MMR deficiency is correlated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and some forms of sporadic tumors. HNPCC also referred to as Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant-inherited disorder characterized by predisposition to colorectal cancer and extracolonic malignancies, frequent multiple primary tumors in the same patient, and early age of cancer onset. A clinical variant of Lynch syndrome, Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is characterized by the association between one or more visceral malignancies, with at least one sebaceous skin tumor or keratoacanthoma. Turcot syndrome is characterized by the concurrence of primary brain tumors and colon cancers and/or multiple colorectal adenomas.

DESCRIPTION Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a familial clustering of early onset tumors including sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas (ADR). Initially considered as a rare syndrome, LFS and its variants are increasingly recognized as one of the most frequent and diverse forms of predisposition to cancer. Most cases identified and characterized to date are associated with dominantly inherited germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (p53). In a subset of non-p53 patients with LFS, CHEK2 has been identified as another predisposing locus. LFS is diagnosed on the basis of the confirmed clinical diagnostic criteria.

NAME        Lipoprotein glomerulopathy
DESCRIPTION Lipoprotein glomerulopathy is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by disturbed remnant lipoprotein catabolism and intravascular glomerular deposition of lipoprotein-containing thrombi. Patients usually present with proteinuria and hypertension, microhematuria is rare, and renal function becomes impaired. Rare mutations in apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.

NAME        Nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypophosphatemic
DESCRIPTION Nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypophosphatemic is a genetically heterologous group of disorders characterized by the formation of renal calcium stones or bone demineralization due to impaired renal phosphate reabsorption. It is caused by either mutations in NPT2A, a sodium-phosphate cotransporter expressed in kidney and polarized osteoclasts, or in sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF)1, that controls renal phosphate transport by trafficking NPT2A.

DESCRIPTION Azoospermia is a disorder in which there is a complete absence of sperm in the semen. It is classified as obstructive azoospermia caused by problems with sperm transport and nonobstructive azoospermia caused by failure of spermatogenesis. Y-linked gene USP9Y has been implicated in moderate oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and azoospermia. SYCP3 mutations lead to complete infertility due to meiotic arrest.

DESCRIPTION FG syndrome (FGS), also known as Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, is a rare X-linked multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation (MCA/MR) disorder characterized by high clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity. The cardinal features of the syndrome are congenital hypotonia, delayed development of speech, relative macrocephaly (as compared to height and weight), anal anomalies or severe constipation, and dysmorphic facial features. Five loci have so far been linked to this phenotype on the X chromosome. A recurrent missense mutation in the MED12 gene has been identified as the cause for the subset of FGS cases. Filamin A gene (FLNA) and CASK gene mutations could be another causes of FG syndrome.

NAME        Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
DESCRIPTION Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease, primarily affecting women. Abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) within the lung is responsible for cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma and leads to chronic respiratory failure. Another characteristic feature of the disease is the development of fluid-filled lymphatic cystic structures (lymphangioleiomyomas) in the axial lymphatics and of angiomyolipomas in the kidneys. Its presentation is sporadic or associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, a dominant autosomal neurocutaneous syndrome. Both disorders have their origin in mutations of the tuberous sclerosis genes TSC1 and TSC2, which are involved in the regulation of cell signs critical for energy control and cell nutrition processes.

NAME        Pontocerebellar hypoplasia
DESCRIPTION Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a group of inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorders with prenatal onset. Up to now seven different subtypes have been reported. All subtypes share common characteristics, including hypoplasia/atrophy of cerebellum and pons, progressive microcephaly, and variable cerebral involvement. Mutations in three tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit genes were found to be responsible for PCH2, PCH4 and PCH5. Mutations in the nuclear encoded mitochondrial arginyl- tRNA synthetase gene underlie PCH6. PCH1 is caused by homozygous mutation in the VRK1 gene.

            Mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia;
            Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML)
DESCRIPTION Myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anaemia (MLASA) is a rare autosomal recessive oxidative phosphorylation disorder specific to skeletal muscle and bone marrow. MLASA has been associated with a missense mutation in pseudouridylate synthase 1 (PUS1), an enzyme located in both nucleus and mitochondria, which converts uridine into pseudouridine in several cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNA positions and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis in both compartments. Recentry, it has been reported that a mutation of the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene, YARS2, also causes MLASA. Myopathy with succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase deficiency has been found to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the iron-sulphur cluster scaffold protein (ISCU). ISCU is essential for the activity mitochondrial iron-sulphur proteins such as succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase.

NAME        Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI)
DESCRIPTION Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an inherited aminoaciduria caused by defective amino acid transport at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in intestine and kidney. Patients affected by this disorder, in general, come to medical attention from early on in life with several significant problems including failure to thrive and intellectual impairment. LPI is caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, which encodes the y+LAT-1 protein, the catalytic light chain subunit of a complex belonging to the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family.

NAME        Cystinuria
DESCRIPTION Cystinuria is a inherited disorder of re-absorptive transport of cystine and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, arginine and lysine in the proximal tubule and small intestine. Diagnostically, urinary levels of dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine, and most prominently, of cystine are constantly elevated. Plasma levels of these amino acids in general are at the lower end of the normal range. Patients with cystinuria often present with nephro- or urolithiasis at almost at any age with a clear preference in childhood due to elevated urinary cystine. Early diagnosis is important, as it allows prevention or diminution of kidney stones. Mutations in either interacting subunit SLC3A1 (rBAT) or SLC7A9 (b0,+AT) cause cystinuria. Cystinuria due to mutations in SLC3A1 is an autosomal recessive trait, whereas mutations in SLC7A9 can be seen as an autosomal dominant trait.

NAME        Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria
DESCRIPTION Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria (DA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a striking excretion of urinary glutamate and aspartate, resulting from the incomplete reabsorption of anionic amino acids from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. DA is generally considered to be a benign disorder, but cases with mental retardation have been reported as well. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SLC1A1 could be associated with DA.

DESCRIPTION Choreoathetosis, hypothyroidism, and neonatal respiratory distress is a syndrome of congenital hypothyroidism associated with pulmonary problems, mental retardation, muscular hypotonia and persistent ataxia which could be described as choreoathetosis. This disorder is attributed to mutations of the NKX2.1, a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the developing thyroid, respiratory epithelium, and specific areas of the forebrain during embrypgenesis.

DESCRIPTION Warsaw breakage syndrome is a cohesinopathy characterized by cellular defects in sister chromatid cohesion and hypersensitivity to agents that induce replication stress. It is caused by defective DDX11/ChlR1, a XPD helicase family member. In Warsaw breakage syndrome, features of Fanconi anemia (chromosomal breakage) and Roberts syndrome (sister chromatid cohesion defects) coexist, and individuals with this disorder show severe microcephaly, facial dysmorphy, pre- and post- natal growth retardation, and abnormal skin pigmentation.

NAME        Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC);
            Bourneville-Pringle disease
DESCRIPTION Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), also known as Bourneville-Pringle disease, is a rare, slowly progressive genetic disorder characterized by pervasive benign tumors in most organ systems including the brain, skin, kidney, liver, lung, and heart, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with TSC are frequently diagnosed with comorbid neurological disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, behavioral dysregulation, sleep disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). TSC most often results from spontaneous genetic mutations in one or two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These gene products form a physical and functional complex to limit activation of the mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. When these genes are deficient, mTOR complex 1 is constitutively up-regulated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and protein synthesis.

NAME        Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)
DESCRIPTION Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder characterized by an idiopathic failure of the automatic control of breathing. It is frequently associated with a broad spectrum of dysautonomic symptoms, suggesting the involvement of genes widely expressed in the autonomic nervous system. In particular, the ASCL1-PHOX2A-PHOX2B developmental cascade was proposed as a candidate pathway. Recently, It has been showed that PHOX2B is the major CCHS locus, whose mutation accounts for 60% of cases.

NAME        Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs)
DESCRIPTION Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are rare hereditary disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and by distinct morphological abnormalities of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. Non-erythroid hematopoietic cell lineages are morphologically normal. Three types of the disease are known as type I, II and III, and there is also a huge group of congenital forms that cannot be included with any of the three canonical types. CDA type II is the most widely spread form. CDA type III is the rarest of the three classical types of CDA and both familial and sporadic cases have been reported.

DESCRIPTION Arterial tortuosity syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tortuosity, elongation, stenosis and aneurysm formation in the large and medium-sized arteries with defective elastic fibers of the arterial wall. Other features of this disease are characteristic face and several connective tissue manifestations. It has been speculated that arterial tortuosity syndrome is caused by the upregulation of TGF-beta signaling that stimulates vessel wall cell proliferation, but other mechanism involving disturbed transport of ascorbate, a cofactor for collagen and elastin hydroxylases, has been proposed recently.

NAME        Severe combined immunodeficiency with microcephaly, growth retardation, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation;
            NHEJ1 syndrome
DESCRIPTION Severe combined immunodeficiency with microcephaly, growth retardation, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation is a syndrome associated with T and B cell-combined lymphocytopenia, growth retardation, microcephaly, and increased cellular radiosensitivity. Mutations in human NHEJ1 can lead to lymphocytopenia due to its role in V(D)J recombination in the immune system. This disease shows features common with the ones observed in LIG4 deficiency or Nijmegen breakage syndrome.

NAME        Precocious puberty, including:
            Central precocious puberty (CEPREPU);
            Familial male precocious puberty (FMPP)
DESCRIPTION Precocious puberty has been classically defined as the onset of secondary sexual characteristics in girls younger than 8 years old and in boys younger than 9 and a half years old. Central precocious puberty (CEPREPU) refers to a gonadotropin-dependent type which results from premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). CEPREPU is much more frequent in girls than in boys (up to 20:1 ratio). Recently, kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) and its ligand, kisspeptin, were revealed as major gatekeepers of puberty onset. Mutations of the KISS1R gene were described in patients with impaired pubertal development. On the other hand, it has been reported that heterozygous mutations of the LHCGR gene cause gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males, but have no detectable effects on prepubertal or postpubertal females.

DESCRIPTION G6PC3 deficiency is a syndromic variant of severe congenital neutropenia associated by complex organ malformation. Patients often have cardiac defects such as atrial septal defects, an increased superficial venous marking, and urogenital malformations. In the absence of G6PC3, increased ER stress makes neutrophils prone to undergo apoptosis and leads to defective organ development.

DESCRIPTION Factor XIII deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective cross-linking of fibrin and poor resistance to fibrinolysis. The severity of the bleeding tendency varies from benign symptoms like excessive bruising to life threatening bleeding emergencies such as intracranial hemorrhages. In plasma, FXIII circulates as a pro-transglutaminase composed of two catalytic A subunits and two non-catalytic B subunits. Symptoms that are almost pathognomonic for A subunit deficiency are umbilical bleeding in the neonatal period and repeated fetal wastage in pregnant females.

NAME        Renal hypouricemia (RHUC)
DESCRIPTION Renal hypouricemia (RHUC) is a disorder characterized by impaired uric acid reabsorption at the apical membrane of proximal renal tubule cells, and high urinary urate excretion. Renal urate reabsorption is controlled via two proximal tubular urate transporters: apical URAT1 (SLC22A12) and basolateral GLUT9 (SLC2A9). And it has been suggested that RHUC is caused by mutations in URAT1 or GLUT9. Most of patients were asymptomatic, but some had nephrolithiasis or were predisposed to exercise-induced acute renal failure.

            Goltz-Gorlin syndrome
DESCRIPTION Focal dermal hypoplasia, also known as Goltz-Gorlin syndrome, is a rare X-linked dominant disorder characterized by patchy dermal hypoplasia and fat herniation through skin in combination with skeletal, ocular and dental abnormalities. Skeletal dysplasia consisting of syndactyly, polydactyly, camptodactyly or ectrodactyly and ocular anomalies such as colobomas, microphthalmia or cataract are frequently reported. Mutations in the PORCN gene has been shown to cause the disease.

            Granular corneal dystrophy type III
DESCRIPTION Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD) is a progressive autosomal dominant dystrophy and patients are born with normal appearing corneas. In the first or second decade of life, corneal opacification and scarring cause marked visual loss and recurrent corneal erosions lead to significant pain. In RBCD, Bowman's membrane is disrupted or absent and instead is replaced by a fibrocellular tissue with deposition of rodlike bodies best seen with the electron microscope. Thiel-Behnke dystrophies (TBCD) share many similarities as well as some differences with RBCD. Both RBCD and TBCD are linked to mutations in the TGFBI gene.

DESCRIPTION Thiel-Behnke dystrophy (TBCD) is an autosomal dominant dystrophy with recurrent corneal erosions developing in the first and second decade of life. TBCD shares many similarities with Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD), but decreasing visual acuity is seen later than with RBCD. Electron microscopy reveals curly fibers deposited in Bowman's layer and this finding differentiates it from RBCD. Both TBCD and RBCD are linked to mutations in the TGFBI gene. TBCD is also linked to a mutation on chromosome 10q23-24, the gene product is currently unknown.

            Primary familial amyloidosis
DESCRIPTION Gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDCD) is a rare autosomal recessive dystrophy characterized by multiple prominent milky-white gelatinous mulberry-shaped nodules formed beneath the corneal epithelium during the first decade of life. Clinical symptoms include photophobia, foreign body sensation, and decreased vision. Fusiform deposits similar to those in lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) may also form in the deeper stroma. GDCD has been linked to mutations in the TACSTD2 gene. TACSTD2 is a cell surface phosphoglycoprotein as well as a substrate for protein kinase C. Mutations in the gene lead to a truncated protein which is thought to trigger amyloid formation in the cornea.

            Fehr corneal dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD), inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, is the least common but severe form of stromal dystrophy characterized by superficial gray-white corneal opacities that progressively increase to involve the entire corneal stroma from limbus to limbus. Patients experience progressive decreased vision and irritation as the diseases worsens, and will have vision severely affected by the third to fourth decade of life. It has been shown that a specific sulfation step in the production of keratan sulfate, the major glycosaminoglycan of the corneal stroma, is impaired in MCD. This results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans that form the abnormal deposits. Mutations in the CHST6 gene, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfation of keratan sulfate, are responsible for most cases of MCD.

DESCRIPTION Granular dystrophy (GCD), inherited in an autosomal dominant fasion, is one of the most common corneal dystrophies characterized by the deposition of gray-white crumb like opacities in the anterior stroma that slowly increase in number and progress into deeper parts of the cornea. The disease is typically asymptomatic, but can present with pain from recurrent erosions and decreased vision. Opacities in granular dystrophy are composed of eosinophilic hyaline deposits. Differences in the clinical appearance of the discrete corneal opacities permit to divide into types of GCD; Type I classic form of GCD, type II Avellino or granular-lattice type, and type III Reis-Bucklers type. GCD has been linked to several mutations in TGFBI gene.

DESCRIPTION Fleck corneal dystrophy (FCD) is a rare corneal dystrophy characterized by multiple asymptomatic, non-progressive symmetric minute flecks disseminated throughout the corneal stroma. FCD does not affect vision and does not require treatment, but mild photophobia has been reported. Histopathology of the affected areas showed that the flecks correspond to areas of swollen keratocytes with cytoplasmic vesicles that contain lipids and mucopolysaccharides. FCD has been associated with mutations in the PIP5K3 gene encoding for an enzyme with a dual specificity that has both protein and lipid kinase activity.

DESCRIPTION Congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD) is a rare condition characterized by numerous opaque flaky or feathery clouding of the corneal stroma. The flakes and spots become more numerous with age and are slowly progressive to decrease the visual acuity. In CSCD, the morphologic abnormalities include a peculiar arrangement of tightly packed lamellae having highly aligned collagen fibrils of an unusually small diameter. Refractive error, photophobia, strabismus and resulting amblyopia with searching nystagmus are common in affected individuals. CSCD is linked with mutations in the decorin gene, which encodes for a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan.

            Crystalline stromal dystrophy;
            Schnyder crystalline dystrophy sine crystals
DESCRIPTION Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is a corneal dystrophy that is characterized by deposition of cholesterol in the corneal stroma. SCD usually becomes apparent early in life with corneal clouding or with crystals within the corneal stroma. Over time, an initially unremarkable corneal stroma acquires small white opacities and a diffuse haze. In approximately 50% of cases, crystals are not evident clinically (Schnyder crystalline dystrophy sine crystals). Most cases of SCD lack an obvious systemic disorder, but hypercholesterolemia is common, and so are associated manifestations, such as arcus lipoides and xanthelasma. An opaque disc of corneal crystals or other lipids may diminish vision sufficiently in both eyes to result in the need for a corneal graft. SCD is caused by one of numerous mutations in the UBIAD1 gene.

NAME        Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FECD);
            Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is characterized by progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells, thickening of Descemet membrane, and deposition of extracellular matrix in the form of guttae. As a result, the endothelial layer is eventually no longer able to support corneal deturgescence, leading to corneal edema and decreased in visual acuity. These findings usually become clinically evident in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Corneal transplantation is currently the only modality used to restore vision. FECD is a genetically complex disorder, but the familial risk is relatively high. Candidate gene studies of COL8A2, solute carrier family 4, sodium borate transporter, member 11 (SLC4A11), and transcription factor 8 (TCF8) have found mixed evidence for potentially causal variants.

NAME        Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD)
DESCRIPTION Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is a very rare, bilateral autosomal dominant disorder affecting primarily the innermost corneal layers, Descemet membrane (DM), and the endothelium, biomicroscopically presenting as geographical lesions, bands, and vesicles. It primarily affects the corneal endothelium to produce epithelial-like transformation and irregular thickening of DM due to the deposition of an abnormal collagenous layer. Most cases are static, but occasionally rapid progression can result in severe visual disability from secondary glaucoma or corneal edema. Three genes have been reported as causing PPCD: VSX1 associated with PPCD1, COL8A2 responsible for PPCD2, and ZEB1 shown to cause PPCD3. The contribution of changes in VSX1 and COL8A2 to the pathogenesis of this dystrophy is considered to be minor compared to ZEB1.

NAME        RIDDLE syndrome
DESCRIPTION RIDDLE (radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features, and learning difficulties) syndrome is an immunodeficiency disorder that primarily manifests as an immunoglobulin deficiency. The underlying genetic cause of this syndrome is defective RNF168 that functions to recruit DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins, such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, to sites of DNA damage. As with patients with other DSB repair disorders, the RIDDLE patients also present with nonimmunological characteristics including short stature and motor control problems.

NAME        Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED);
            Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy type 1;
            Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy type 2;
            Corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness (CDPD);
            Harboyan syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a rare inheritable disorder of the corneal endothelium characterized by bilateral symmetric corneal clouding (edema) with varied severity from mild opacification to milky, ground-glass opacification without other anterior segment abnormalities, usually evident at birth or in the early years of life. Two subtypes of CHED based on differences in the mode of inheritance are known, an autosomal dominant (CHED1) and an autosomal recessive (CHED2) type. Clinically, both forms of the disorder are similar; the distinction between them is made by the age at onset and the presence or absence of associated symptoms. Both CHED1 and CHED2 have been mapped to chromosome 20. The Solute Carrier family 4 (sodium borate cotransporter) member 11 (SLC4A11) has been identified as the candidate gene for CHED2. Mutations in SLC4A11 are described in Harboyan syndrome, which is characterized as CHED2 with hearing loss. Most patients with CHED have severe visual impairment and often require penetrating keratoplasty.

NAME        Rotaviral enteritis;
            Rotaviral gastroenteritis
DESCRIPTION Rotavirus is the most important cause of acute infantile gastroenteritis and causes 611 000 deaths worldwide each year. Infections have been reported to occur repeatedly in humans and most of cases in adults are asymptomatic. Infections in young children lead to acute diarrhea. Symptoms of rotavirus infection are non-specific and include vomiting and diarrhoea, occasionally accompanied by a low grade fever. Dehydration occurs in 40 to 80% of patients and is the most common cause of death. Viral NSP4 enterotoxin is responsible to the diarrhoea by eliciting calcium mobilization in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.

NAME        Colorblindness, including:
            Dichromacy;
            Anomalous trichromacy
DESCRIPTION Colorblindness is the inability or decreased ability to perceive color differences. Dichromacy is a condition characterized by reduced dimension of color vision in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. Anomalous trichromacy is the milder form of color vision deficiency, with ability to discriminate between different colors in varying degrees but not normal. Dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy are subdivided into three types: protan, deutan, and tritan depending on the affected cone type. Protan and deuten types consist red-green defects. Inherited red-green color vision defects affect 8% of males. Tritan type defect leads to inherited blue-yellow defect that is fairly rare.

            Sugio-Kajii Syndrome (TRPS3)
DESCRIPTION Trichorhinophalangeal syndromes (TRPS) is a rare peripheral dystosis with mainly autosomal dominant inheritance. Three different forms of TRPS are known: type I (TRPS1), type II (TRPS2) and type III (TRPS3). They are characterized by sparse hair, bulbous pear-shaped nose, long and flat philtrum, thin upper lip, and protruding ears. Skeletal abnormalities that are frequently observed include epiphyses of the middle phalanges with shortened metacarpals, hip malformations, and short stature. The causative gene is TRPS1 that was shown to be a regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway in mouse.

NAME        Thrombocytopenia (THC);
            Familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM)
DESCRIPTION Thrombocytopenia is defined by a decrease in the number of platelets in circulating blood, resulting in the potential for increased bleeding and decreased ability for clotting. Inherited syndromes are relatively rare causes of thrombocytopenia, but some genes underlying these disorders have been elucidated. Some inherited syndromes predispose to the development of bone marrow failure or leukemia. For example, familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM) is characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects, and propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukemia.

NAME        Caudal regression syndrome and Sirenomelia
DESCRIPTION Caudal dysgenesis and sirenomelia are rare malformations that represent a spectrum of caudal anomalies. Clinical findings include varying degrees of agenesis of the vertebral column (usually sacral or lumbosacral spine), as well as anorectal and genitourinary anomalies. The most severe end of this spectrum is known as sirenomelia that is characterized by fused lower limbs. These are caused by developmental field defects of blastogenesis involving the caudal mesoderm and usually sporadic.

DESCRIPTION Bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is a rare recessive genetic immune disorder endorsed by a partial or complete absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression. BLS could be grouped as type I, type II, and type III based on defective surface MHC expression. A feature of loss in constitutive and inducible MHC II proteins have been grouped as BLS type II. The abnormality of the transcription factors, which combine to form a singular transcription complex essential for the initiation of the transcription of MHC II, contributes to the development of BLS type II. BLS type III is recognized by the loss of both MHC I and MHC II molecules.

            Pena-Shokeir syndrome, type 1
DESCRIPTION Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired fetal movement and resulting developmental defects. Fetal movement is essential for normal fetal development and growth. Intrauterine movement restriction causes growth retardation, congenital limb contractures, pterygia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and hydramnios.

NAME        Familial skewed X-chromosome inactivation
DESCRIPTION X chromosome inactivation is the transcriptional silencing of the majority of genes on one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian females that equalizes the effective dosage of X-linked genes between XX females and XY males. Therefore mammalian females are mosaics for two cell populations with different X chromosomes active. Skewed X inactivation is defined as a pattern where the cells show a preferential inactivation of one X chromosome. The incidence of skewing is shown to be age dependent but in general, skewing does not have any biologic consequence. However, in cases of individuals with nonlethal mutated allele, degree of skewing is predisposing to genetic diseases such as hemophilia A. The key player is the X inactivation-specific transcript (XIST), an X-linked untranslated RNA that coats the inactive X-chromosome.

DESCRIPTION CATSHL syndrome is characterised by camptodactyly, tall stature, scoliosis, and hearing loss. The syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the FGFR3 gene. FGFR3 is a negative regulator of bone growth, and its mutations are well known to cause a variety of short-limbed bone dysplasias and craniosynostosis syndromes. The finding of CATSHL syndrome indicates that abnormal FGFR3 signaling can cause human anomalies by promoting as well as inhibiting endochondral bone growth.

NAME        Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL)
DESCRIPTION Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) is a rare autosomal dominant microvascular endotheliopathy with middle-age onset. At around the age of 45, affected individuals may develop retinal and cerebral dysfunction. Death occurs in most cases within 10 years of the first symptoms appearing. The disease-causing mutations of TREX1 lead to truncation and abnormal localization of the 3'-5' exonuclease.

NAME        Hereditary angioedema
DESCRIPTION Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder, manifested by recurrent episodes of angioedema localized to the skin or mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract or larynx. The laryngeal angioedema is potentially lethal. The classic forms, HAE types I and II, result from deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Type I HAE is caused by decreased expression of C1INH in the plasma whereas type 2 HAE, consisting approximately 15% of patients with HAE, is due to expression of a dysfunctional C1INH protein. HAE type III has been observed exclusively in women and appears to be correlated with high estrogen levels.

DESCRIPTION The C syndrome/ Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome is characterized by trigonocephaly and associated anomalies, such as unusual facies, psychomotor retardation, redundant skin, joint and limb abnormalities, and visceral anomalies. The C syndrome is caused by mutations in CD96, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Because of close similarity between both syndromes, Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOPS) is considered the more severe form of the C syndrome, therefore known as C-like syndrome. Recently, It has been reported that de novo nonsense mutations in ASXL1 cause BOPS.

DESCRIPTION Occult macular dystrophy (OMD) is an inherited or sporadic macular dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of macular function but normal ophthalmoscopic appearance. Patients with OMD have normal full-field electroretinograms (ERGs), but the focal macular ERGs (FMERGs) and multifocal ERGs are abnormal. OMD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, patients with sporadic disease have been also reported. Mutations in RP1L1 gene, which plays essential roles in the cone functions, are responsible for OMD.

NAME        Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency;
            Isolated ACDH deficiency (IAD)
DESCRIPTION Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (IAD) is a rare disease characterized by low plasma ACTH and cortisol levels and preservation of all other pituitary hormones, that may be an underestimated cause of neonatal death. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the human TPIT (TBX19) gene were detected in IAD. TPIT is a T-box transcription factor with a specific role in differentiation of the corticotroph lineage. It has been reported that TPIT mutations are responsible for two thirds of neonatal-onset complete IAD but can not be detected in partial or late-onset IAD.

NAME        Adult i phenotype
DESCRIPTION Adult i phenotype is a rare autosomal recessive condition that was found to be highly associated with congenital cataract. The I and i antigens are carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface of a variety of tissues and body fluids. Most adult red blood cells (RBCs) abundantly express I antigen. Conversion of the i antigen into an I structure takes place during the first 18 months after birth as a result of the expression of a specific transferase, I-branching GCNT2. Lack of this enzyme results in the adult i phenotype.

DESCRIPTION Human sparganosis is caused by larval form (spargana) of the canine/feline tapeworms belonging to the genus Spirometra. A wide range of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals serve as second intermediate/paratenic hosts. Humans become infected by drinking contaminated water, eating undercooked meat of infected frogs or snakes, or by applying poultices of frog or snake flesh on open wounds in traditional medical treatment in parts of southeast Asia. Spargana invade the brain, eyes, spinal cord, breast, and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in blindness, paralysis, and even death.

NAME        Choanal atresia and lymphedema
DESCRIPTION Choanal atresia and lymphoedema is a rare congenital malformation caused by loss-of-function mutation in PTPN14 encoding a nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase. PTPN14 has been shown to interact with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is essential for lymphangiogenesis. The mechanism responsible for the development of chanal atresia is not clear but believed to be failure of the breakdown of the bucconasal membrane during embryogenesis.

DESCRIPTION Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a highly lethal form of inherited primary electrical myocardial disease characterized by exercise- and stress-related adrenergic ventricular tachycardia without structural cardiac abnormalities. It manifests as syncope and sudden death and can be caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) accounting for an autosomal dominant form (CPVT1) or mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin gene CASQ2 accounting for an autosomal recessive form (CPVT2). It was also reported that absence of the inhibitory G-Protein Galphai2 predisposes to ventricular tachycardia.

NAME        Optic atrophy (OPA)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary optic atrophy (OPA) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a sudden or gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells function. OPA results from degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. Symptoms include a variable association of decreased visual acuity, visual field defects, and color vision abnormalities. All nonsyndromic OPAs characterized to date result from defects in genes encoding mitochondria-related proteins. The most frequent forms of nonsyndromic OPA are autosomal dominant OPA1-linked OPA (OPA1) and mitochondrial DNA-linked, maternally inherited Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). By contrast, autosomal recessive forms of optic atrophies (arOAs) are less frequent, and most cases are syndromic (e.g., OPA3 or Type III 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and OPA7). Isolated or nonsyndromic arOAs are believed to be extremely rare.

            Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency;
            Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (AKGDH) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Diseases of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) constitute a group of rare human diseases that affect core mitochondrial metabolism. The Fumarase deficiency is caused by impairment of the fumarate hydratase enzyme. The symptoms of the disorder include developmental delay, severe mental retardation, language impairment, seizures and dysmorphic facial features. The succinate dehydrogenase deficiency affects mitochondrial complex II, which links the TCA cycle with the electron transport chain. The phenotype is highly variable and can include Leigh syndrome, leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and mental and motor skill deterioration. The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency is extremely rare and characterised by encephalopathy and hyperlactatemia resulting in death in early childhood.

NAME        Juvenile polyposis syndrome
DESCRIPTION Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is an autosomal dominant condition identified by the presence of multiple benign, non-cancerous polyps called juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. A germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found in about 50%-60% of patients with JPS. These genes play a role in the BMP/TGF-beta signalling pathway.

NAME        Familial adenomatous polyposis
DESCRIPTION Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by the early onset of hundreds to thousands of adenomas throughout in the rectum and colon. If left untreated, all patients with FAP develop colon cancer a decade after the appearance of the polyps. The genetic defect in FAP is a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. In a subset of individuals, a MUTYH mutation causes a recessively inherited polyposis condition.

NAME        Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (A/M)
DESCRIPTION Anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia (A/M) can be defined as an absence or reduced size of the globe in the orbit. Anophthalmia refers to complete absence of the globe in the presence of ocular adnexae. Microphthalmia is defined as a globe with a total axial length that is at least two standard deviations below the mean for age. Coloboma, or a defect in the closure of the choroid fissure, is most common ocular malformation associated with microphthalmia. Coloboma is considered to be part of the A/M spectrum. A/M can be isolated, associated other anomalies or part of a well defined syndrome. A/M have complex aetiology with chromosomal, monogenic and environmental causes identified.

NAME        Cornea plana congenita
DESCRIPTION Cornea plana congenita is a rare hereditary anomaly in which the normal protrusion of the cornea from the sclera is missing. Clinical features include hyperopia, slight microcornea, an extended limbus zone, and arcus lipoides seen even before the age of 20. Cornea plana congenita occurs in a mild autosomal dominant (CNA1) and a more severe autosomal recessive (CNA2) form. CNA2 has a high prevalence in the Finnish population due to strong founder effect.

DESCRIPTION Orthostatic intolerance (OI) or postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system primarily affecting young females, and is characterized by lightheadedness, palpitations, fatigue, altered mentation, and syncope primarily occurring with upright posture and being relieved by lying down. Patients often have high plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in relation to sympathetic outflow on standing. Abnormal norepinephrine transporter (NET) function is considered to contribute to the pathophysiology in some patients with OI. The impaired uptake of NE could be caused by a mutation in the SLC6A2 gene that encodes the NET.

NAME        Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
DESCRIPTION Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is typically an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction (OI) occurring during the luteal phase or early pregnancy. OHSS is characterised by a cystic enlargement of the ovaries and an acute fluid shift from the intravascular to the third space, which may result in ascites, pleural infusions, pericardial infusion, and even generalized edema. Majority of OHSS cases have been associated with the use of gonadotrophins for OI in anovulatory women or for ovarian stimulation (OS) in the context of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Recurrent cases and familial occurrence of OHSS have been described, and different mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHr) have been reported in these cases. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) appears to be the major predisposing factor for OHSS in a large number of studies.

DESCRIPTION Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome is congenital hypothyroidism associated with choanal atresia, bifid epiglottis, and abnormal hair. It has been suggested that mutations in FOXE1 are associated with Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome. FOXE1 is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family and functions as a thyroid transcription factor which likely plays a crucial role in thyroid morphogenesis.

DESCRIPTION Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the genus Schistosoma parasites. Schistosomiasis is the third most devastating tropical disease in the world and WHO estimates 600 million people at risk of infection with 200 million infected. Among nonimmune patients, host's immune response to schistosome eggs leads to acute schistosomiasis that is characterized by cercarial dermatitis and 'Katayama fever'. Life-threatening cardiac and neurological complications may occur. Schistosome eggs can also leads to chronic fibrotic response in host tissues, causing gastrointestinal and liver diseases.

DESCRIPTION Fascioliasis is a foodborne zoonotic disease caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. Whereas in Europe, the Americas and Oceania only F. hepatica is concerned, the distributions of both species overlap in many areas of Africa and Asia. Two hosts are needed for these species to complete their life cycle. The definitive host range is very broad and includes many herbivorous mammals, including humans. Intermediate hosts are freshwater snail species of the family Lymnaeidae. For many years, and still commonly used, bithionol was the first-line agent for the treatment of fascioliasis.

DESCRIPTION Molluscum contagiosum is a highly contagious poxvirus infection of the mucous membranes and skin that usually affects school-aged children. The infection is transmitted by close physical contact, fomites, and autoinoculation. It is a benign and self-limiting disease, with the majority of lesions spontaneously resolve within 2-4 years without active treatment.

NAME        Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
DESCRIPTION Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an uncommon intravascular hemolytic anemia that results from the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutations in an X-linked gene, termed PIG-A. PIG-A is required for the biosynthesis of a lipid moiety, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), that attaches dozens of different proteins to the cell surface. PIG-A mutations block GPI anchor biosynthesis, resulting in a deficiency or absence of all GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface. This deficiency on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis since certain GPI anchored proteins normally function as complement regulators.

NAME        Pediculosis, including:
            Head lice infestation;
            Body lice infestation
DESCRIPTION Pediculosis is the result of infestation by one of two distinctly different families of sucking lice, the Pediculidae and the Pthiridae. Both of them produce equivalent disorders, with itching, bites, and nits on the hairs. Head louse infestation is one of the most frequently occurring parasitic diseases in children, crossing all social and geographic boundaries. Body lice preferentially affect the displaced. They are major vectors of diseases such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.

            Common toxocariasis
DESCRIPTION Human toxocariasis is the disease caused by infection of zoonotic roundworms Toxocara canis and T. cati, whose definitive hosts are dogs and cats, respectively. Humans become infected by ingesting either embryonated eggs from soil or raw vegetables. Toxocara larval migration in the body can cause four clinical syndromes, namely visceral larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, and covert/common toxocariasis. These are frequently associated with fever, abdominal pain, cough, wheeze, and hepatomegaly. Ocular larva migrans can lead to visual loss.

NAME        Pentosuria
DESCRIPTION Pentosuria is an autosomal recessive inherited condition to be inborn errors of metabolism characterized by high levels of the pentose sugar L-xylulose in blood and urine. The condition is completely clinically benign. Mutations have been identified in the DCXR gene encoding L-xylulose reductase, which are predicted to lead to loss of enzyme activity. In pentosuria, failure to convert L-xylulose to xylitol leads to accumulation of L-xylulose.

NAME        Acute alcohol sensitivity
DESCRIPTION Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are important enzymes that eliminate toxic aldehydes by catalysing their oxidation to non-reactive acids. It is reported that a deficiency in the ALDH2 is associated with the alcohol flush reaction. More than 40% of the East Asians population carries a common ALDH2 mutant allele, which results in a dramatic reduction in the enzymatic activity when compared with the wild-type allele.

            PHGDH Deficiency
DESCRIPTION 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the synthesis of the amino acid L-serine characterized clinically by congenital microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and infantile onset of intractable seizures. The biochemical abnormalities associated with this disorder are low concentrations of L-serine, D-serine, and glycine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Mutations have been identified in PHGDH, the gene encoding 3-PGDH.

NAME        Lymphatic filariasis
DESCRIPTION Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic nematode infection that is endemic in 81 countries worldwide with 1.2 billion people at risk and an estimated 120 million infected, especially in tropical regions. Wuchereria bancrofti accounts for 91% of the cases while Brugia malayi and B. timori (which has a distribution restricted to South and Southeast Asia) infections account for the other 9%. Disease pathogenesis is linked to host inflammation invoked by the death of the adult parasite, manifesting as recurrent debilitating fevers, hydrocoeles, lymphangitis and lymphadenitis, and elephantiasis.

NAME        Human hookworm infections, including:
            Ancylostomiasis;
            Necatoriasis
DESCRIPTION The majority of human hookworm infections are caused by Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus. These worms attach to the intestinal mucosa and live for 1-5 years, sucking host blood. The major clinical features of chronic hookworm infection are iron-deficiency anemia and malnutrition, which are associated with varying degrees of cognitive and growth delay in children.

            Lung fluke disease;
            Benign endemic hemoptysis
DESCRIPTION Paragonimiasis (also known as lung fluke infection) is a food-borne parasitic disease caused by infection with trematodes belonging to the genus Paragonimus. Human infections occur by consuming freshwater crustaceans (second intermediate host) or wild boar meat (paratenic host). Paragonimiasis is generically insidious in its onset and mildly chronic in its course. The symptoms are characteristically referable to the chest, abdomen, lymph nodes or brain. The diagnostic signs include cough, blood-tinged sputum and, less frequently, hemoptysis, distressing chest pain and dyspnea. The drugs of choice for treatment of paragonimiasis are praziquantel and bithionol.

DESCRIPTION Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in PKLR that encodes both L-PK (expressed in liver, renal cortex, and small intestine) and R-PK (restricted to erythrocytes). The symptoms include jaundice, enlargement of the spleen, and hemolysis, leading to anemia. One hundred fifty-eight mutations associated with non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia and eight polymorphic sites have been so far reported in the PKLR gene. It has also been found that a specific mutation in the PKLR gene causes hereditary increase of red blood cell ATP.

NAME        Strongyloidiasis
DESCRIPTION Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal parasite infection caused by soil-transmitted helminths of the genus Strongyloides. The disease infects 30 million people in 70 countries especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Strongyloides stercoralis has a complex life cycle. In humans, larvae reach the host's duodenum or jejunum and develop there into adult worms. Only females are found in the host where they are embedded in the duodenum and jejunum mucosa, producing eggs. These hatch, develop into infective larvae and penetrate the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin. Infection usually results in asymptomatic chronic disease of the gut, but in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, hyperinfection can occur with dissemination of larvae to multiple organs including the brain. The mortality rate of disseminated infections has been estimated to be as high as 87%.

DESCRIPTION Pituitary adenomas are an important and frequently occurring form of intracranial tumour. They are usually benign but can give rise to severe clinical syndromes due to hormonal excess, or to visual/cranial disturbances due to mass effect. The tumour can be clinically nonfunctioning or hormone secreting. Among the latter, prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas are the most common. The majority of pituitary adenomas arise sporadically, although a subset occurs as component tumors of well-characterized familial cancer syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Carney complex, and MEN1-like syndrome (MEN4). It has been described non-MEN/CNC familial pituitary tumours that include all tumour phenotypes as a condition named familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA).

NAME        Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by low plasma levels of A1AT. The condition is associated with emphysematous lung disease and also with liver disease. A1AT is the archetype of the serine protease inhibitor. Mutations in the A1AT gene lead to misfolding of the protein and accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The accumulation of mutant A1AT protein has a directly toxic effect on the liver, resulting in hepatitis and cirrhosis. And the decrease in circulating A1AT results in protease-antiprotease imbalance at the lung surface and emphysema ensues.

NAME        Loiasis
DESCRIPTION Loiasis is an infection with Loa loa, a filarial parasite found in central Africa. The adult worms migrate freely through the subcutaneous tissues and sometimes can be observed moving through the sclera of the eye. Loiasis is often asymptomatic, but when a person has both onchocerciasis and loiasis, administration of ivermectin can cause serious neurological complications.

NAME        Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) deficiency is a disorder resulting in increased fibrinolysis and an associated bleeding diathesis. PAI-1 is an important component of the coagulation system that down-regulates fibrinolysis in the circulation. Affected individuals exhibit mild to moderate bleeding symptoms, including epistaxis, menorrhagia, and delayed bleeding after trauma or surgical procedures. Spontaneous bleeding events are rarely seen in contrast to other procoagulant deficiencies. Generally most of the PAI-1-related diseases are due to elevated antigenic concentrations and their inhibitory activity. However, absence of cellular PAI-1 activity also causes several diseases. Clear documentation of PAI-1 deficiency as a cause of a bleeding disorder has been rare.

DESCRIPTION Human genetic platelet glycoprotein IV (CD36) deficiency may be related to the phenotypic expression of the metabolic syndrome and is frequently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. CD36 deficiency is relatively frequent in Asian and African populations. It also has been reported that CD36 deficiency might be linked with cardiomyopathy. This deficiency can be classified in two subgroups: the type I phenotype is characterized by platelets and monocytes/macrophages that exhibit CD36 deficiency; whereas in the type II phenotype, the surface expression of CD36 is lacking only in platelets, but expression is near normal in monocytes/macrophages.

DESCRIPTION Pneumothorax is defined as air or gas accumulated in the pleural space and can be classified as spontaneous or traumatic. Traumatic pneumothorax includes iatrogenic cases caused during procedures such as pacemaker insertion. Spontaneous pneumothorax can be subclassified as primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), which is defined as a pneumothorax without underlying lung disease, predominantly occurs in young, thin males. It is usually caused by ruptured pleural blebs or bullae. Approximately 10% of patients with PSP have a positive family history. Gene mutations in folliculin (FLCN) have been found.

NAME        Cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD)
DESCRIPTION Cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD) is a rare abnormality of cortisone metabolism. There are close phenotypic similarities between CRD and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, anovulatory infertility, obesity, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. 11beta-HSD1 is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of cortisone to cortisol within the endoplasmic reticulum. And loss of its activity results in CRD. Mutations in H6PD, which encodes an enzyme supplying cofactor for the reaction, also have been identified as the cause of CRD.

DESCRIPTION Ocular coloboma is a congenital and common malformation which includes a deficiency of the structures of the eye, such as the iris, retina, choroid, or optic disc. It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs. Paired box gene 6 (PAX6), a member of the paired box family of transcription factors, has been identified as a key regulator of eye development. Currently around 500 mutations of PAX6 have been reported. And most PAX6 nonsense mutations lead to aniridia, while missense mutations are related to foveal hypoplasia, congenital cataracts, or anterior segment anomalies.

NAME        Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)
DESCRIPTION Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a mitochondrial disorder associated with mtDNA depletion and/or accumulation of mtDNA point mutations and deletions. PEO is characterized by late onset bilateral ptosis and progressive weakening of the external eye muscle, resulting in blepharoptosis and ophthalmoparesis, proximal muscle weakness, and wasting as well as exercise intolerance. Muscle biopsy results typically show ragged red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers. PEO is transmitted as dominant or recessive traits.

NAME        Prolidase deficiency (PD)
DESCRIPTION Prolidase deficiency (PD) is a severe autosomal recessive disorder due to the lack of prolidase (EC:3.4.13.9), a peptidase with a preference for Xaa-Pro dipeptide substrates that participates in collagen metabolism and in the terminal degradation of endogenous and dietary proteins. It typically begins in childhood and common symptoms include chronic intractable skin ulcerations and mental retardation. Mutations in prolidase gene causing the reduction or the loss of prolidase activity are responsible for PD.

NAME        Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)
DESCRIPTION Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterised by alveolar accumulation of surfactant composed of proteins and lipids due to defective surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. PAP is caused by a disruption in surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages due to loss of functional granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling. Three main categories of PAP have been defined depending on the aetiology: auto-immune, secondary, and genetic. Genetic PAP can result from mutations in CSF2RA, the gene encoding the alpha chain of the GM-CSF receptor and seen especially in children. Adult forms are mostly auto-immune (with GM-CSF antibodies) and/or secondary to toxic inhalation or hematological disorders, without anti-GM-CSF antibodies. Autoimmune PAP is the most common form (90%).

Mitochondrial HMGCS2 is involved in hepatic ketogenesis, and HMGCS2 deficiency causes hypoketotic hypoglycaemia after prolonged fasting. To date, no mutations have been identified in the human cytosolic HMGCS1.

DESCRIPTION Pyridox(am)ine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes intractable seizures that are not responsive to anticonvulsant drugs and pyridoxine. Patients with this deficiency have very low concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), leaving exogenous pyridoxal/PLP as the only source of the active cofactor. Clinically, this disease presents with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy with severe seizures which do not respond to anticonvulsant drugs or pyridoxine but shows a dramatic response to PLP. Pathogenic mutations in PNPO gene have been identified.

DESCRIPTION Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) is a recessively inherited form of hemolytic anemia characterized by peripheral blood morphology presenting with striking anisopoikilocytosis with red cell fragmentation and microspherocytes. Erythrocytes from most HPP patients exhibit qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin, the principal structural component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Qualitative spectrin defects are typically associated with missense mutations that lead to abnormal spectrin self-association, a process critical for membrane structure and function.

DESCRIPTION Late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD) is a rare autosomal dominant ocular disease characterized by onset in the fifth to sixth decade with night blindness and punctate yellow-white deposits between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane, progressing to severe central and peripheral degeneration, with choroidal neovascularization and chorioretinal atrophy. L-ORD is caused by a mutation in the CTRP5 (C1QTNF5) gene, which encodes a short-chain collagen, changing a highly conserved serine to arginine (Ser163Arg). The mutation results in abnormal high molecular weight aggregate formation which may alter its higher-order structure and interactions.

DESCRIPTION Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease in which the reduction of the circulating blood cells results from damage to the stem cell pool in bone marrow. Most cases of acquired aplastic anemia are the consequence of an immune-mediated destruction of hematopoiesis. Autoreactive cytotoxic T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of AA by myelosuppressive cytokines including interferon-gamma. It has been reported that polymorphisms in IFNG are related to AA. A minority of patients with AA has heterozygous mutations in genes encoding the telomerase components TERT or TERC. Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is one of the main treatment modalities for AA, although most patients with telomerase mutations do not respond adequately to IST.

NAME        Reynolds syndrome
DESCRIPTION Reynolds syndrome is a rare disease associating primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and systemic scleroderma (SSc). It is typically classified as an autoimmune disorder since there are specific autoantibodies associated with both facets of the disease (antimitochondrial antibodies for PBC and anticentromere/antitopoisomerase for SSc), and suggestive microscopical abnormalities in the skin and liver. A mutation in the Lamin B receptor gene has been discovered in the white blood cells, suggesting that nuclear signalling defects could be a cause in Reynolds syndrome.

NAME        Rhabdoid predisposition syndrome (RPS)
DESCRIPTION Rhabdoid predisposition syndrome (RPS) is familial cases of highly malignant, aggressive, embryonal neoplasms manifested in early infancy and childhood that may originate from virtually any tissue, generally resulting in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) in the central nervous system and malignant rhabdoid tumors in the kidney or retroperitoneum. The vast majority demonstrate biallelic somatic inactivation of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor within tumor cells. Mutations in SMRCA4 gene have also been identified.

NAME        Carboxypeptidase N deficiency
DESCRIPTION Carboxypeptidase N (CPN) is a plasma zinc metalloprotease that inactivates C3a, C4a, C5a, bradykinin, kalladin, and fibrinopeptides. CPN has been implicated as a major regulator of inflammation. Although deficiency of CPN produces a severe allergic syndrome, there are no reported cases of complete deficiency of CPN in humans. There are a few documented cases of partial CPN deficiency. Patients present some combination of angioedema or chronic urticaria, as well as hay fever or asthma. It has been reported that mutations in CPN1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of CPN, cause CPN deficiency.

NAME        Vitamin D-dependent rickets
DESCRIPTION Rickets is the failure of growing bone to mineralize. Many skeletal and radiographic changes can occur because of the lack of calcified osteoid and the buildup of unossified cartilage. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type I results from abnormalities in the gene coding for 25(OH)D3-1-alpha-hydroxylase and vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, and type II results from defective vitamin D receptors. Both diseases are rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and early onset severe rickets.

NAME        Human echinococcosis
DESCRIPTION Human echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by the larval stages of the cestode parasites Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis, affecting an estimated 2-3 million people worldwide. Contamination of humans occurs by the ingestion of the parasite eggs, either after touching carnivore hosts, or after eating food contaminated by carnivore feces. E. granulosus causes benign tumors/cysts (hydatid cyst disease) that is most often curable. Disease due to E. multilocularis (alveolar hydatid disease) is less common but more difficult to treat. In echinococcosis, anaphylactic reactions might occur with fatal outcome.

DESCRIPTION Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is the most common cause of ventricular pre-excitation, a condition where all or part of the ventricle is excited earlier than would normally be expected, often leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. It was recently discovered that mutations in PRKAG2, that encodes a subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase, is responsible for WPW syndrome.

NAME        Roussy-Levy syndrome
DESCRIPTION Roussy-Levy syndrome (RLS) is a dominantly inherited early-onset syndrome consisting of gait ataxia, pes cavus, areflexia, eventually associated with muscle atrophy, postural tremors, limb ataxia, kyphoscoliosis, and sensory loss. The RLS subtype is not genetically homogeneous. RLS has been described as a phenotypic variant of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [DS:H00264] type 1A (CMT-1A) associated with duplications of the PMP22 gene. A mutations in the MPZ gene has been revealed indicating that the original RLS may fall under the CMT-1B subgroup of hereditary demyelinating neuropathies.

NAME        Scott syndrome
DESCRIPTION Scott syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive congenital bleeding disorder caused by a defect in blood coagulation. When platelets are activated, a calcium-induced rearrangement of the platelet membrane phospholipids takes place, exposing negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) at the outer surface of the platelets, where it can anchor coagulation factors. This phenomenon is mediated by lipid scramblase. In patients with Scott syndrome this mechanism is defective, resulting in impaired blood clotting. A mutation in the gene encoding scramblase TMEM16F has been found.

NAME        Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a distinct form of hereditary early-onset spastic ataxia related to progressive degeneration of the cerebellum and spinal cord. ARSACS is clinically characterized by spasticity, ataxia, polyneuropathy, retinal changes, and in some cases late cognitive decline. Patients demonstrate an unsteady gait and experience frequent falls as they learn to walk. ARSACS is caused by mutations in the SACS gene, encoding a large protein sacsin. A recent study demonstrated that sacsin may interact with the Hsp70 chaperone machinery, which is an important component of the cellular response towards aggregation prone mutant proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

NAME        Staphylococcal infection
DESCRIPTION Staphylococci are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. Firstly, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a most unusual coagulase-negative staphylococcus found on the human skin. It can cause infections at many sites including superficial skin infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and breast abscess. Endocarditis caused by S. lugdunensis can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Secondly, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, found among the normal skin flora, is commonly isolated from the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas of humans and causes septicemia, peritonitis, otitis, and urinary tract infections. S. haemolyticus is notorious for its multidrug resistance and historically early acquisition of resistance to methicillin and glycopeptide antibiotics. Finally, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an important opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats. S. pseudintermedius colonization is very uncommon in humans. It is rarely isolated from human dog-bite wounds. The infection has been associated with wide range of symptoms such as bacteremia, a brain abscess, and pneumonia.

NAME        Uncomplicated urinary tract infection
DESCRIPTION Staphylococci are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram-positive uropathogen and frequently isolated from young female outpatients presenting with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. S. saprophyticus causes uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) but no severe bacterial infectious disease as caused by S. aureus. The urease of S. saprophyticus is known to be a virulent factor for the persistent infection in the urinary tract. All of the virulence factors of S. aureus, such as coagulase, hemolysins, enterotoxins, extracellular matrixbinding proteins, and exoenzymes, are absent in the S. saprophyticus genome. Besides S. saprophyticus is a leading gram-positive uropathogen of uncomplicated UTI, a restricted group of gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. is often observed to cause uncomplicated UTI.

NAME        Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN)
DESCRIPTION Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN) is a neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical degeneration of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and occasionally the globus pallidus, with little involvement of the rest of the brain. The clinical features of IBSN include developmental regression, choreoathetosis, dystonia, spasticity, dysphagia, failure to thrive, nystagmus, optic atrophy, and mental retardation. The mechanism of IBSN has not been elucidated, although it has been reported that IBSN usually occurs as a result of metabolic, familial, or toxic diseases. Mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene (complex V) have been described in families with mitochondrial inheritance, while there is much evidence that supports the role of the mutation in nup62 as the cause of autosomal recessive IBSN.

NAME        Myiasis
DESCRIPTION Myiasis is a parasitic infection of vital tissue of skin and mucous membranes by dipterous larvae. Human myiasis is a rare clinic condition but more prevalent in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Myiasis may be classified into three types: (i) primary myaisis in which the larva invades healthy tissue of the host, (ii) secondary myaisis where the adult female is attracted to and lays its eggs on wounded skin, and (iii) accidental myaisis caused by ingestion of contaminated food. Among many species of Diptera that cause larval infection in humans, Dermatobia hominis, the human botfly, is responsible for the painful, boil-like lesion of furuncular myiasis.

DESCRIPTION Tungiasis is a tropical ectoparasitosis caused by the penetration of small hematophagous flea (Tunga penetrans). It is prevalent where people live in extreme poverty, occurring in many Latin American countries. Contamination with adult females occurs when walking barefoot in the sand. After penetration, most commonly on the feet, the flea increases in volume, causing pruritus in hosts. After they eject the eggs, the lesion heals within a few days.

DESCRIPTION Sveinsson chorioretinal atrophy (SCRA), also referred to as helicoid peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration (HPCD), is a distinct autosomal dominant disease affecting both eyes characterized clinically by bilateral, well defined, tongue-shaped strips of atrophic retina and choroid that extend from the optic nerve into the peripheral ocular fundus. The lesions may be evident at birth and usually progress throughout life, sometimes leading to central visual loss. Clinical findings suggest that the expansion of the degenerative lesions is caused by dysplastic abnormalities of the peripapillary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the mechanical tearing of the RPE layer owing to the growth of the globe. Patients with SCRA have a mutation in the TEAD1 gene.

DESCRIPTION T-cell immunodeficiency congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (TIDAND) is a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) syndrome caused by a mutation in FOXN1 gene encoding the forkhead/winged helix (WHN) FOXN1 transcription factor selectively expressed in thymic epithelia and skin. SCIDs are disorders of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity, characterized by high susceptibility to develop severe and sometimes fatal infections. TIDAND is the only human SCID caused by an intrinsic abnormality of the epithelial component of the thymus. The disease is always associated with a profound T-cell defect.

A missense mutation has been found in the basic region of the MITF (microphthalmia associated transcription factor) gene. Mutations in other regions of this gene have been found to produce Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) [DS:H00169], which also includes pigmentary changes and hearing loss, but in contrast to Tietz syndrome, depigmentation is patchy and hearing loss is variable in WS2.

NAME        Tn syndrome
DESCRIPTION Tn syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the expression of the Tn antigen, an incompletely glycosylated membrane glycoprotein, on all blood cell lineages. The epitope of the Tn antigen is terminal alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine alpha-linked to either a serine or threonine amino-acid residue. The defect may be due to a malfunction of the glycosylating enzyme T-synthase. Tn syndrome is associated with a somatic mutation in Cosmc gene, encoding a molecular chaperone that is required for the proper folding and hence full activity of T-synthase.

NAME        Transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency is an inborn error of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), presenting primarily with liver disease and variable clinical course. TALDO is one of the key enzymes the PPP. The severity of the symptoms can vary, ranging from fetal hydrops to slowly progressive liver cirrhosis, but patients show common symptoms like hydrops fetalis, dysmorphic features, liver dysfunction (cirrhosis), hemolytic anemia with renal involvement, and heart problems. The biochemical profile indicates an elevated level of erythritol, arabitol, ribitol, sedoheptitol, perseitol, sedoheptulose, mannoheptulose, and sedoheptulose-7P. The disorder is caused by mutations in the TALDO gene.

NAME        Transcobalamin II deficiency
DESCRIPTION Transcobalamin (TC) II deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) transport that leads to intracellular Cbl depletion with secondary impairment of methionine synthetase and methyl-malonyl CoA mutase activities. This disorder presents with failure to thrive, mucosal ulceration, vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, irritability, and occasionally immunological dysfunction. Affected individuals may suffer from long-term neurological sequelae if therapy with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin is not initiated promptly. Mutations in the TCN2 gene are known to cause.

DESCRIPTION Asthma is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with many etiologic factors and clinical characteristics. In some patients with asthma, aspirin and all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) trigger asthmatic attacks. This clinical syndrome is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of nasal and bronchial tissue, often associated with nasal polyps. It has been reported that genetic variations in TBX21 are associated with susceptibility to asthma with nasal polyps and aspirin intolerance.

NAME        Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC)
DESCRIPTION Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC) refers to a group of disorders inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, distinguished by the development of ectopic and vascular calcified masses that occur in settings of hyperphosphatemia (hFTC) and normophosphatemia (nFTC). hFTC is characterized by increased re-absorption of phosphate through the renal proximal tubule, resulting in elevated phosphate concentration and deposition of calcified deposits in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues, occasionally, in visceral organs. hFTC has been shown to result from mutations in three genes: fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), KL encoding Klotho, and GALNT3, which encodes a glycosyltransferase responsible for FGF23 O-glycosylation; defective function of any one of these three proteins results in hyperphosphatemia and ectopic calcification. nFTC is characterized by absence of metabolic abnormalities. nFTC has been found to be associated with absence of functional SAMD9, a putative tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory protein.

            X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2)
DESCRIPTION Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is a congenital disorder characterized by a skeletal abnormality, characterized by punctate calcification of the cartilage of the epiphyses, larynx and trachea. Different forms of CDP exist, the most common of which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait (Rhizomelic CDP). CDP may also be inherited in a recessive and dominant X-linked fashion. The X-linked recessive CDP (CDPX1) characterized by facial anomalies with severe nasal hypoplasia, short stature, and distal phalangeal hypoplasia. Mutations in ARSE which encodes arylsulfatase E, showing a high sequence homology to steroid sulfatase. In X-linked dominant CDP (CDPX2), aberrant punctate calcification in cartilage is most prominent around the vertebral column, pelvis, and long bones. Additionally, CDPX2 patients may have asymmetric rhizomesomelia, sectorial cataracts, patchy alopecia, ichthyosis, and atrophoderma. It has been found that defects in D8-D7 sterol isomerase (EBP) cause CDPX2 and suggest a role for sterols in bone development.

NAME        VACTERL/VATER association
DESCRIPTION The acronym VATER/VACTERL association refers to the rare, non-random co-occurrence of vertebral defects (V), anorectal malformations (A), cardiac defects (C), tracheo-esophageal fistula with or without esophageal atresia (TE), renal malformations (R), and limb defects (L). It is typically defined by the presence of at least three of these cardinal features. The aetiology has been identified only in a small fraction of patients to date, likely due to factors such as a high degree of clinical and causal heterogeneity, the largely sporadic nature of the disorder, and the presence of many similar conditions. Chromosomal abnormalities have been described in rare individual cases and proposed as possible causal factors, including: deletions of distal 13q, ring chromosome 12, and 6q; duplication on 9q;  mutations in PTEN, HOXD13, and ZIC3; and a mitochondrial substitution.

NAME        Hyperalphalipoproteinemia
DESCRIPTION Hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP) is a condition of elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. The most important cause of primary HALP is a genetic deficiency of CETP, which has been reported mainly from Japan. A mutation in APOC3 gene is also associated in some families. Familial HALP often coexists with longevity, and that higher HDL-C levels are found among healthy elderly. HALP is also associated with some diseases. Recent studies have shown that hetero and homozygosity for CETP gene mutations is associated with an increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.

NAME        Cataract
DESCRIPTION Cataracts can be defined as any opacity of the crystalline lens, often associated with breakdown of the lens microarchitecture, possibly including vacuole formation and disarray of lens cells, which can cause large fluctuations in density resulting in light scattering. In addition, light scattering and opacity will occur if there is a significant amount of high molecular weight protein aggregates. Cataracts can be classified by the age at onset: a congenital or infantile cataract presents within the first year of life; a juvenile cataract presents within the first decade of life; a presenile cataract presents before the age of about 45 years, and senile or age-related cataract after that. Congenital cataracts are a major cause of induced blindness in children, and inherited cataracts are the major cause of congenital cataracts. Inherited congenital cataracts have been associated with mutations in specific genes, including those of crystallins, gap junction proteins, membrane transport and channel proteins, the cytoskeleton, and growth and transcription factors. Inherited congenital cataracts may be inherited as autosomal dominant (most frequent), autosomal recessive, or X-linked traits.

NAME        Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG)
DESCRIPTION Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a severe form of glaucoma that presents early in life. PCG results from developmental abnormalities that affect the aqueous humor outflow pathway. PCG clinical features include elevated IOP, corneal edema, enlargement of the globe (buphthalmos), corneal enlargement, rupture of Descemet's membrane, and optic nerve damage. Two genes have been reported to cause PCG, CYP1B1 and LTBP2. Both genes cause a recessive form of this disease.

NAME        Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation (MR), and dysequilibrium syndrome (CAMRQ)
DESCRIPTION Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation (MR), and dysequilibrium syndrome (CAMRQ) is autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous conditions characterized by early onset of cerebellar ataxia and MR. Patients with CAMRQs have a severe disturbance of posture and balance, strabismus, muscular hypotonia during childhood and they have a delayed ability to walk independently. The disease is also characterized by perceptual difficulties and in most cases mild mental retardation. Three subtypes have been mapped so far. CAMRQ1 and CAMRQ3 are caused by mutations in the VLDLR and CA8 genes, respectively, while the gene for CAMRQ2 remains to be cloned.

NAME        Coumarin resistance;
            Warfarin resistance
DESCRIPTION Warfarin is widely prescribed anticoagulant for the prevention of thromboembolic diseases. However, its use is made difficult by the wide interindividual variation in dose required to achieve a therapeutic effect, the narrow therapeutic range, and the risk of serious bleeding. Warfarin dose requirement is influenced by factors such as intake of vitamin K, ethnicity, age, gender, and genetic factors. Warfarin acts through interference with the recycling of vitamin K in the liver. It has been reported that mutations in VKORC1, CYP2C9, and GGCX cause warfarin resistance.

DESCRIPTION Plasminogen deficiency is characterized by decreased serum plasminogen activity. Two forms of the disorder are distinguished. Type 1, also called hypoplasminogenemia, is associated with pseudomembrane disease. Ligneous conjunctivitis is the most common of the clinical syndromes associated with plasminogen deficiency, although numerous other organs have been reported to be affected. Type 2, also known as dysplasminogenemia, is characterized by normal, or slightly reduced antigen levels, and absence of clinical manifestations.

DESCRIPTION Globozoospermia is a rare form of teratozoospermia, mainly characterized by round-headed spermatozoa that lack an acrosome. Acrosome plays an important role at the site of sperm-zonapellucida binding during the fertilization process. It was suggested that a homozygous mutation in SPATA16 was associated with male infertility in human globozoospermia. It has also been reported that a recurrent deletion of DPY19L2 causes infertility in man by blocking sperm head elongation and acrosome formation.

NAME        Deafness, X-linked
DESCRIPTION Hereditary deafness is divided into syndromic forms (in which hearing loss is associated with a variety of other anomalies) and non-syndromic forms. Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal-dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. X-linked deafness is clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. PRPS1 and POU3F4 have been identified as the genes to be implicated in X-linked non-syndromic hearing loss.

NAME        MECP2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy
DESCRIPTION MECP2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy is a rare disorder of males characterized by a static encephalopathy, severe developmental delays, hypotonia, seizures, and respiratory abnormalities that often leads to death at an early age. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause this disease, and females with these same mutations typically have a disorder called Rett syndrome. Most boys with this disorder have been identified because they have female siblings with Rett syndrome.

DESCRIPTION Gallbladder disease is one of the most common digestive disorders. Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder wall, that is almost always associated with cholelithiasis, or gallstones. Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis appear to be caused by the actions of several genes and environment working together. It has been reported that an ABCB4 mutation which causes a deficiency in biliary phosphatidylcholine secretion is associated with gallstones. Recently, several common DNA polymorphisms in the ABCG8 gene were discovered that are associated with gallstone disease.

NAME        Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA)
DESCRIPTION Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is a chronic itchy skin disorder associated with amyloid deposits in the superficial dermis. It is a purely cutaneous disease with no association with systemic forms of amyloidosis. Clinically, skin lesions comprise small, flat-top papules (lichen amyloidosis) or brown-gray macules (macular amyloidosis). PLCA is relatively common in South America and Asia, and some cases have an autosomal dominant family history (familial PLCA, FPLCA). The genetic basis of FPLCA involves mutations in the OSMR and IL31RA genes. Both belong to the family of interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokine receptors.

DESCRIPTION Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy (EBMD) is a common bilateral epithelial dystrophy. There is usually no hereditary pattern, but some cases presented with an autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TGFBI/BIGH3 genes, which are known to cause various forms of corneal dystrophies, have been identified. Sheet-like areas of basement membrane originating from the basal epithelial cells of the corneal epithelium and extending superficially into the epithelium are the hallmarks of EBMD. Most patients are asymptomatic before the age of 30 years, but 10% of them may have recurrent idiopathic erosions and a loss of vision due to surface irregularity.

KPD can be classified into four A beta groups, based on the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65, GAD67, or IA-2 autoantibodies (A+ or A-) and beta-cell functional reserve (beta+ or beta-). Homozygous carriers of the PAX4 R133W variant have an increased risk of KPD.

NAME        D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA)
DESCRIPTION D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder. Clinical symptoms of D-2-HGA are developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. It has been suggested that mutations in the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene cause D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Recently, IDH2 mutations in patients with D-2-HGA were reported.

            Preaxial polydactyly type-IV;
            Postaxial polydactyly types A1 and B
DESCRIPTION GLI3 morphopathies are autosomal dominant developmental defect syndromes, including Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, preaxial polydactyly type-IV, and postaxial polydactyly. All GLI3 morphopathies show malformations of the autopod, such as polydactylies or syndactylies. Heterozygous mutations in human GLI3, a zinc-finger transcription factor, are associated with these syndromes. GLI3 is regarded as a mediator of sonic hedgehog signaling regulating development at multiple sites such as the limbs, the lungs, and the brain.

NAME        Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
DESCRIPTION Inflammatory bowel disease is a heterogeneous group of chronic disorders, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients suffer chronically from abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding, and malabsorption. In most patients, these disorders are manifested in adolescence or adulthood, however, they may present in infancy and may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It has been reported that mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune responses in the intestine. Additional genes associated with the disease have been identified.

DESCRIPTION Insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with acanthosis nigricans (IRAN) is an unusual cause of diabetes that result from metabolic abnormalities associated with mutations of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene, characterized by phenotypic description of extreme insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism. Other phenotype of IRAN form includes hirsutism and polycystic ovarian disease in a patient who is usually not obese. There is no distinctive serum marker. Leprechaunism [DS:H00719] and the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome [DS:H00942] also have mutations in INSR with subsequent alterations in insulin receptor function and extreme insulin resistance.

NAME        Inclusion body myopathy 3 (IBM3)
DESCRIPTION Inclusion body myopathy 3 (IBM3) is an autosomal dominant myopathy associated with a heterozygous missense mutation in the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIa gene (MYH2), changing the highly conserved and negatively charged glutamate at position 706 to the positively charged lysine (E706K). This region is important for myosin functioning during muscle contraction, because it undergoes conformational changes during adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Clinical characteristics include congenital joint contractures, a progressive course in adulthood, and external ophthalmoplegia.

DESCRIPTION Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical widespread myelin loss in the central nervous system. Although a phenotype is similar to that of multiple sclerosis, ADLD neuropathology shows preservation of oligodendroglia in the presence of subtotal demyelination and lack of astrogliosis.  It has been reported that ADLD can be caused by a tandem genomic duplication resulting in an extra copy of the lamin B1 gene.

NAME        Trimethylaminuria (TMAU);
            Fish-odor syndrome
DESCRIPTION Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish odour syndrome, is a metabolic disorder. TMAU usually presents with a body odour resembling that of rotten or decaying fish, the result of excess excretion of trimethylamine (TMA) in the breath, sweat, urine, and reproductive fluids. Primary TMAU is most often caused by a functional defect of flavin mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3), and the genetic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner as a consequence of mutations in the FMO3 gene. Secondary TMAU has been described in patients with severe liver disease (which is the major site of activity of the FMO3 enzyme) and chronic renal disease (as a consequence of bacterial overgrowth in the gut), and in patients treated with large doses of betaine or possibly L-carnitine. In addition, transient TMAU has been reported in a preterm infant who was fed with choline-rich food supplements and has been reported in some women just at the onset of menstruation.

DESCRIPTION Chondrocalcinosis is a common cause of joint pain and arthritis caused by calcium deposition in articular cartilage and the presence of calcium hypophosphate crystals in synovial fluid, cartilage and periarticular soft tissue. Although most cases are sporadic, rare familial forms have been linked to human chromosomes 8 (CCAL1) or 5p (CCAL2). It has been suggested that mutations in the ANKH gene, which is located on the chromosome 5p, are one cause of chondrocalcinosis.

Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency results from defects in the enzyme sulfite oxidase, which is responsible for the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Several mutations have been identified from patients suffering from isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. The more common molybdenum cofactor deficiency [DS:H00192] leads to combined defects in xanthine dehydrogenase and sulfite oxidase, as sulfite oxidase is 1 of 3 enzymes in humans that requires molybdenum as a cofactor, the other 2 being xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. The seizures in isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency may even begin prenatally, and are much more severe compared with those in molybdenum cofactor deficiency.

DESCRIPTION Combined SAP deficiency is a fatal infantile lysosomal storage disorder with hepatosplenomegaly and severe neurological disease. It is caused by mutations in the PSAP gene leading to absence or non-functionality of the prosaposin protein. Mammalian prosaposin encodes in tandem four small acidic activator proteins (saposins) with specificities for glycosphingolipids hydrolases.

NAME        Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP);
            Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura
DESCRIPTION Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder, and the most common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia in children. Destruction of autoantibody-sensitized platelets by Fc[gamma]R-bearing phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system plays an important role. ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options. It has been reported that the activating FCGR2C-ORF genotype predisposes to ITP by altering the balance of activating and inhibitory Fc[gamma]R on immune cells.

NAME        Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)
DESCRIPTION Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is defined as a protrusion of abdominal viscera into the thorax through an abnormal opening or defect that is present at birth. CDH is often associated with potentially lethal lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Despite advances in therapy, mortality remains high. Although the etiology of most cases of CDH remains unknown, there is increasing evidence that specific pathways and genes play a role in the development of CDH. It has been reported that a patient who has nonsense mutation in FOG2/ ZFPM2, died at birth with a diaphragmatic defect and severe pulmonary hypoplasia.

NAME        Saccharopinuria
DESCRIPTION Saccharopinuria is a metabolic disorder caused by a defect in a bifunctional protein with lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) activity and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), which catalyzes the first two steps in the lysine-degradation pathway. Patients with this disorder have both hyperlysinemia and saccharopinuria, although the saccharopinuria is much more severe. It seems likely that this disorder results from specific mutations in the portion of AASS encoding SDH, which could explain the high levels of saccharopine, compared with that in patients with hyperlysinemia [DS:H00188].

DESCRIPTION Huntington's disease (HD), which is caused by a triplet-repeat expansion in the IT15 gene (also known as huntingtin or HD), accounts for about 90% of cases of chorea of genetic etiology. In recent years, several other distinct genetic disorders have been identified that can present with a clinical picture indistinguishable from HD, termed HD-like (HDL) syndromes. So far, four genes associated with HDL syndromes have been identified, including the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2) and, the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (HDL4).

DESCRIPTION Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is an autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a therapeutic response to pharmacological dosages of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) and resistance to conventional antiepileptic treatment. Antiquitin (ATQ) deficiency is the main cause of PDE. Antiquitin is encoded by ALDH7A1 gene, and functions in the lysine degradation pathway. Its deficiency results in accumulation of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA), piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C) and pipecolic acid, which serve as diagnostic markers in urine, plasma, and CSF.

NAME        Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by impaired intestinal folate absorption. HFM is characterized by anemia, hypoimmunoglobulinemia, and recurrent infections. When diagnosed early, the signs and symptoms can be obviated by high oral doses of folates. Recently, several mutations were identified in the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) gene from patients with HFM.

NAME        Isolated follicle-stimulating hormone deficiency (IFSHD)
DESCRIPTION Isolated follicle-stimulating hormone deficiency (IFSHD) can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the beta chain of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  FSH is essential for normal puberty and fertility in females, particularly ovarian follicular development beyond the antral stage. In males, FSH is necessary for normal spermatogenesis and when FSH function is completely absent, infertility occurs. With partial FSH deficiency in males, spermatogenesis is affected, but fertility may still be possible.

NAME        Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF)
DESCRIPTION Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. Recent studies on the molecular basis of the disease have disclosed specific genetic defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. Seven different loci have been associated with hyperinsulinism: ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADHSC, GCK, GLUD1, SLC16A1, and INSR. Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC. Diazoxide is often ineffective in mutations of the ATP- dependent potassium channel and may not adequately control hypoglycemia in GCK or SLC16A1 mutations.

NAME        Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome;
            HHH syndrome
DESCRIPTION Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by mental retardation, progressive spastic paraparesis, seizures, and myoclonus epilepsy. This disease varies widely in its severity and age of onset. The HHH syndrome is thought to be caused by the defective activities of the mitochondrial carrier responsible for transporting ornithine from the cytoplasm into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in the SLC25A15 gene, that encodes the mitochondrial ornithine transporter have been shown to be correlated with the HHH syndrome.

            Hyperthyroidism non-autoimmune (HTNA)
DESCRIPTION Congenital hyperthyroidism is a rare clinical condition, and in most cases, it is a transient disorder caused by maternal Graves disease associated with the transplacental passage of maternal thyroid-stimulating antibodies. Germline mutations of thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene determining a constitutive activation of the receptor were identified as a molecular cause of congenital nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism. TSHR gene mutations also causes the familial gestational hyperthyroidism, that is characterized by thyrotoxicosis and hyperemesis gravidarum.

NAME        Spermatogenic failure
DESCRIPTION Spermatogenic failure is reflected in a lower or absent production of spermatozoa and is described by routine semen analysis using terms such as azoospermia, oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia or asthenozoospermia. The genetic causes of spermatogenetic failure still remain largely unknown. It has been estimated that more than 2300 genes play a role in spermatogenesis. But only a few of these genes have been investigated in humans.

NAME        Narcolepsy
DESCRIPTION Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder characterized by irresistible excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, a condition triggered by strong emotions leading to a sudden loss of muscle tone. Narcolepsy is a rare and mainly sporadic disorder. Familial narcolepsy accounts for less than 10% of all narcolepsy cases, and causative mutations have not been identified to date. The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack. It has also been reported that a missense mutation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is the cause of narcolepsy.

NAME        Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is a rare autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by compressive focal neuropathies and an underlying sensorimotor demyelinative polyneuropathy. HNPP is caused by a peripheral myelin protein (PMP22) gene deletion. PMP22 is duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). The other identified underlying genetic defects in HNPP are point mutations in PMP22 that lead to premature or delayed translation.

NAME        Yaws
DESCRIPTION Treponemal infections occurring in humans comprise venereal syphilis and the non-venereal endemic treponematoses. The non-venereal endemic treponematoses are yaws, pinta, and endemic syphilis. Yaws is a chronic, relapsing disease predominantly affecting children living in certain tropical regions. Clinical manifestations of yaws are divided into various stages. Early stage skin lesions are infectious and can persist for weeks or months. Involvement of the bones of the upper and lower limbs and the fingers and toes can cause pain and digital swelling. After the early stage lesions subside due to the host immune response, the patient enters a latent stage that can be lifelong.

NAME        Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC)
DESCRIPTION Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious and severe form of eye disease caused by human adenoviruses (HAdVs). There are two well-defined adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis clinical syndromes: EKC and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) [DS:H01420], which are caused by different HAdV serotypes. HAdV-8, HAdV-19, and HAdV-37 are common causative agents of EKC. In addition to these above-mentioned types, HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, HAdV-9, HAdV-15, HAdV-53, and HAdV-54 have also been identified as causative agents of EKC. However, HAV-8 is responsible for the highest number of EKC cases worldwide and is associated with severe clinical manifestations. EKC patients may complain about influenza-like symptoms, including fever, malaise, respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia. The incubation period is 2-14 days, and the person may remain infectious for 10-14 days after the onset of the symptoms. Symptoms tend to last for 7-21 days.

            Invasive pneumoniae disease;
            Non-invasive pneumoniae disease;
            Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae
DESCRIPTION Pneumococcal disease (PD) is infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). PD is particularly common in younger children and in older adults and is roughly divided into invasive and non-invasive disease; the former refers to infections in which the microorganism is isolated from normal sterile body sites, such as the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid. Non-invasive PD can principally be divided into sinusitis, acute otitis media, and community-acquired pneumonia. S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The invasive PD burden is mainly determined by pneumococcal meningitis, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal bacteremia without a primary focus. Incidence and mortality rates of both non-invasive and invasive disease have changed as a result of pneumococcal vaccination in children. However, especially elderly patients with comorbidities remain vulnerable to morbidity and mortality caused by PD.

DESCRIPTION Pulmonary aspergillus infections can be classified based on clinical syndromes into saprophytic infections, allergic disease and invasive disease. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, occurring in immunocompromised patients, reflects the most serious disease with a high case-fatality rate. Of the 185 recognized species of Aspergillus, 20 are known to cause infections in humans. Aspergillus fumigatus accounts for about 65 percent of all invasive infections in humans and is the mostly encountered species in pulmonary infections. Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans are less frequently causes of invasive and pulmonary infections.

DESCRIPTION Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF), which is caused by Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (H. aegyptius), is a recently described pediatric disease that is often fatal. The vascular destruction is a distinctive trait, and little is known about the mechanism(s) of the overwhelming purpura fulminans that causes the high mortality. This disease is preceded by purulent conjunctivitis which resolves but is followed 10-14 days later by acute onset of fever associated with systemic toxicity, petechiae, purpura, and vascular collapse.

NAME        Dental caries
DESCRIPTION Dental caries occurs due to demineralization of enamel and dentine (the hard tissues of the teeth) by organic acids formed by bacteria in dental plaque through the anaerobic metabolism of sugars derived from the diet. The 2 primary bacteria involved in caries formation are mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. When sugars or other fermentable carbohydrates are ingested, the resulting fall in dental plaque pH caused by organic acids increases the solubility of calcium hydroxyapatite in the dental hard tissues and demineralization occurs as calcium is lost from the tooth surface. The pH at which demineralization occurs is often referred to as the critical pH and is approximately 5.5.

DESCRIPTION Helicobacter heilmannii (H. heilmannii) infection is a relatively rare causative agent of gastroduodenal diseases in children. H. heilmannii frequently colonizes gastric mucosa of animals, mainly cats and dogs, from where it can be transmitted to humans. Generally, H. heilmannii infection is associated with mild gastritis. However, association with duodenal ulcer, acute gastric mucosal lesion, and gastric carcinoma have been observed. In addition, a close association with low-grade primary gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma has been described both in humans and in experimental animals.

NAME        Photorhabdus asymbiotica infection
DESCRIPTION Photorhabdus asymbiotica, a gram-negative bacterium is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes locally invasive soft tissue and disseminated bacteremic infections in the United States and Australia. Australian isolates of P. asymbiotica formed mutualistic association with Heterorhabditis indica, a nematode species but although unproven for P. asymbiotica in North America. Whether this nematode is able to penetrate intact human skin is unclear, although direct skin penetration by nematodes is well recognized (e.g. hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis).

NAME        Encephalitozoon infection
DESCRIPTION The genus Encephalitozoon are spore-forming obligate intracellular microsporidian parasites that infect a wide range of organisms, including protists, invertebrates, humans, and many other vertebrates and known as opportunistic pathogen associated with immunocompromised individuals. Major symptoms include a life-threatening chronic diarrhea and systemic disease. The transmission routes may involve person-to-person as well as waterborne or foodborne, especially in developing countries with poor sanitation. E. intestinalis is recognized as one of the most frequently identified microsporidia in humans, and is associated with diarrhea, malabsorption, cholangitis, cholecystitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, nephritis and intestinal perforation.

            Myosclerosis [DS:H01338]
DESCRIPTION Collagen VI-related myopathy include severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and milder Bethlem myopathy. Mutations in each of the three collagen VI genes COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 cause these diseases. Recently, an additional phenotypes, autosomal recessive myosclerosis with mutations in COL6A2 have been reported. Collagen VI is an important component of the extracellular matrix which forms a microfibrillar network that is found in close association with the cell and surrounding basement membrane. Thus, collagen VI mutations result in disorders with combined muscle and connective tissue involvement, including weakness, joint and contractures, and abnormal skin findings.

NAME        Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) deficiency, including:
            Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in HADHA and HADHB. TFP is a multienzyme complex of the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. Human TFP is an octamer composed of four alpha-subunits harboring long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and four beta-subunits encoding long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. This disease includes a lethal neonatal phenotype with cardiomyopathy and Reye-like syndrome, an infantile hepatic phenotype with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and a childhood or adolescent-onset neuromyopathic phenotype with peripheral neuropathy and recurrent rhabdomyolysis.

NAME        Chromobacterium violaceum infection
DESCRIPTION Chromobacterium violaceum is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that infects both humans and animals. The major symptoms in most of the cases with fatal results seem to be sepsis, multiple liver abscesses, and diffuse pustular dermatitis. Some studies have reported instances of untreated C. violaceum causing brain abscess and diarrhea. Recent findings indicate that the type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by Chromobacterium pathogenicity islands 1 and 1a (Cpi-1/-1a) is critical for C. violaceum pathogenesis.

NAME        Leigh syndrome, including:
            Leigh syndrome, French-Canadian type (LSFC);
            X-linked Leigh syndrome
DESCRIPTION Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Most frequently the central nervous system is affected, with psychomotor retardation, seizures, nystagmus, optic atrophy, ataxia, or respiratory failure. Some patients also present with peripheral nervous system involvement or non-neurologic abnormalities. In the majority of cases, dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex or of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are responsible for the disease. Patterns of inheritance include X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, and mitochondrial.

NAME        Atopic dermatitis
DESCRIPTION Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczematous skin lesions and intense pruritus. A genetic defect in the filaggrin (FLG) protein and/or environmental factors are thought to cause AD by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation. Apart from FLG, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs)  have identified many susceptibility loci of atopic dermatitis with genome-wide significance.

NAME        Anaphylaxis
DESCRIPTION Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, systemic allergic reaction that is almost always unanticipated and may lead to death by airway obstruction or vascular collapse. Anaphylaxis can be triggered by a broad range of triggers. Food is the commonest trigger in children and drugs the commonest in adults. In addition to the environmental influences, studies suggest that a complex of genes affects the anaphylactic response. Anaphylaxis occurs as the result of an allergen response, usually immunoglobulin E-mediated, which leads to mast cell and basophil activation and a combination of dermatologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptoms.

NAME        Allergic rhinitis
DESCRIPTION Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammation of nasal mucosa mediated by IgE-associated processes, which is characterised by pruritus, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, and nasal congestion. The development of AR entails a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to different factors, of which the most important is the implicated allergen. Single-nucleotide polymorphism studies involving genes encoding for molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of AR have also been made. Such molecules comprise chemokines and their receptors, interleukins and their receptors, eosinophil peroxidase and leukotrienes, among others.

NAME        Eosinophilic esophagitis
DESCRIPTION Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune and antigen-mediated clinicopathologic disease that is characterized by eosinophil infiltration into the esophageal epithelium and results in esophageal fibrosis and dysfunction. Several factors contribute to the development of EoE, including genetic predisposition, history of allergies, and presence of environmental and food allergens. Recently, an association between a single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) or eotaxin-3 (CCL-26) and risk for EoE was found.

NAME        Dermatitis herpetiformis
DESCRIPTION Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic, polymorphic, pruritic skin disease that develops mostly in patients with latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy. There is an association with the genotypes HLA DR3, HLA DQw2, found in 80-90% of cases. Owing to the granular immunoglobulin (Ig) A deposition at the tips of the papillary dermis and to the subepidermal blister formation associated with neutrophilic accumulations underlying the basement membrane, DH is considered to be an autoimmune blistering disease.

DESCRIPTION Bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are likely to be caused by viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than viral infection. The contact lens wearers are associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis or keratitis.

DESCRIPTION Infantile liver failure is a life-threatening condition characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, jaundice, distended abdomen, hemorrhagic diathesis, and hypoactivity. Clinically, patients manifest with elevated liver transaminases, hypoglycemia, cholestasis, coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia. It has been reported that infantile liver failure syndrome is caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes. A transient form of infantile liver failure is caused by mutation in the TRMU gene, which encodes a mitochondria specific tRNA-modifying enzyme.

DESCRIPTION Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is a mitochondrial disease that is caused by the lack of the COX. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex IV). Since COX is encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes, COX deficiency can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or a maternal pattern. Patients can present with a number of different clinical phenotypes, including Leigh syndrome, Fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

DESCRIPTION ATP synthase deficiency is mitochondrial disease caused by inborn defects in the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase (respiratory chain complex V). Many patients die within a few months or years. It have been shown to result from mutations in mtDNA genes for the subunits ATP6 and ATP8 or in nuclear genes encoding the biogenesis factors ATPAF2 and TMEM70. Recently, mutations has been found in a nuclear encoded structural complex V subunit, ATP5E and ATP5A1.

NAME        Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked, hereditary disorder due to mutations in the G6PD gene, resulting in protein variants with different levels of enzyme activity, that are associated with a wide range of biochemical and clinical phenotypes. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency. More than 400 biochemical variants of G6PD deficiency have since been defined, and grouped into five classes based on enzyme activity and clinical manifestations. The most common clinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice and acute haemolytic anaemia, which in most patients is triggered by an exogenous agent. A G6PD-deficient patient lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stresses from certain drugs, infections, metabolic conditions, and ingestion of fava beans.

The predominantly preaxial form is called Nager AFD, the predominantly postaxial form of AFD (POADS) is also known as the Genee-Wiedemann or Miller syndrome. Among several AFDs, causative mutations have recently been identified in an enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis in association with Miller syndrome, and in a component of the pre-mRNA spliceosomal complex with respect to Nager syndrome.

            Inherited Antithrombin deficiency
DESCRIPTION Inherited Antithrombin (AT) deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pregnancy loss. AT is a potent inactivator of thrombin and factor Xa and the major inhibitor of blood coagulation. This disease is divided into type I deficiency, in which both the functional activity and antigenic levels AT are proportionately reduced, and type II deficiency, in which normal antigen levels are found in association with low AT activity due to a dysfunctional protein. Type II deficiencies can be further subclassified into three types, depending on the location of the mutations. Type IIa is caused by mutations that affect AT's reactive site. Type IIb is characterized by an abnormality of the heparin-binding domain. Type IIc variants are a pleiotropic group of mutations near the reactive loop site.

            Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS);
            Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO)
DESCRIPTION The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) is the mitochondrial disease, that is caused by mutations of the POLG1 gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma enzyme. ANS includes the phenotypes previously referred to as mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO). MIRAS is a common cause of autosomal recessive juvenile- or adult-onset ataxia, at least in Scandinavia. Most cases of SANDO present with an initial stage of sensory neuropathy, a second stage of progressive external ophahlmoplegia and dysarthria, which is then followed by other symptoms, often with epilepsia or myoclonus.

NAME        Cole disease
DESCRIPTION Cole disease is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by congenital or early-onset punctate keratoderma associated with irregularly shaped hypopigmented macules, which are typically found over the arms and legs, but not the trunk or acral regions. Mutations in ENPP1, encoding ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), are associated with Cole disease. ENPP1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and generates extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate.

            Progressive external ophthalmoplegia [DS:H01118]
DESCRIPTION Except for autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia, all of other POLG-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The POLG-related disorders comprise a continuous spectrum of overlapping symptoms and signs; and range from a rapidly fatal infantile cerebrohepatic disease to a progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) that may not present until the sixth decade of life. The POLG gene is comprised of a polymerase domain, linker region domain and exonuclease domain. Mutations in the polymerase domain tend to result in reduced synthesis of mtDNA. Exonuclease domain mutations result in a high frequency of randomly distributed rare mtDNA point mutations. Mutations within the Linker region can influence the association of POLG with the accessory subunit POLG2.

DESCRIPTION Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, and may result in irreversible brain damage if not treated early and thoroughly. Hyperammonemia can be classified into primary or secondary hyperammonemias depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Detoxification of ammonia is mainly accomplished by the urea cycle in periportal hepatocytes. If the urea cycle is directly affected by a defect of any of the involved enzymes or transporters, this results in primary hyperammonemia.

DESCRIPTION Bacillus thuringiensis is a close taxonomic relative of Bacillus cereus and an insect pathogen that is widely used as a biopesticide. Additionally, this bacterium is known to induce myonecrosis in immunosuppressed mice after cutaneous infection. Human infection is unusual, and apart from gastrointestinal tract infections or those following laboratory contamination, there are only two clinical reports of B. thuringiensis infection. Both the cases were isolated from severe human tissue necrosis by burn wounds or severe war wounds.

DESCRIPTION Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, and may result in irreversible brain damage if not treated early and thoroughly. Hyperammonemia can be classified into primary or secondary hyperammonemias depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Detoxification of ammonia is mainly accomplished by the urea cycle in periportal hepatocytes. The function of the urea cycle may be affected in a secondary way in a number of different situations. For example, intermediary metabolites that accumulate due to enzymatic defects in other pathways, may inhibit the urea cycle. The most relevant group of disorders in this respect is that of organic acidemias. The urea cycle function may be impaired by substrate deficiencies assumed cause in various disorders including lysinuric protein intolerance, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency, and fatty acid oxidation defects. In addition to the urea cycle, mammals require the function of glutamine synthetase to completely detoxify ammonia.

NAME        Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infection
DESCRIPTION The genus Staphylococcus known as pathogen of human and other mammals causes various diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening bacteremia. The two major opportunistic pathogens in the Staphylococcus genus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis, colonize a sizable portion of the human population. S. epidermidis as the predominant species is quite widespread throughout the cutaneous ecosystem, whereas S. aureus colonizes primarily on mucosal surfaces. Staphylococcal infections are commonly caused by S. aureus. However, the infections due to S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci have been also increasing. S. epidermidis is primarily associated with infections of implanted medical devices, such as prosthetic heart valves and joint prostheses. The treatments of staphylococcal infections are complicated by the development of antibiotic resistance, and the remaining effective treatment against most strains of multidrug-resistant staphylococci, including MRSA and MRSE, is the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

DESCRIPTION Punctate palmoplantar keratodermas (PPKPs) are rare autosomal-dominant inherited skin diseases that are characterized by multiple hyperkeratotic plaques distributed on the palms and soles. PPKPs are classified into 3 types; PPKP1 (Brauer-Buschke-Fischer disease), PPKP2 (porokeratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris), and PPKP3 (Acrokeratoelastoidosis lichenoides). PPKP has previously been mapped to chromosomal region 15q22-15q24 and region 8q24.13-8q24.21, but the molecular basis has not been identified yet. Recently, it has been reported that nonsense mutations in AAGAB gene cause PPKP1.

NAME        Streptococcus suis infection
DESCRIPTION Streptococcus suis, a Gram positive coccus, is a zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. Although it is generally carried asymptomatically in adult pigs, it can cause severe systemic disease in piglets, manifested as a rapidly fatal sepsis associated with meningitis, polyarthritis and pneumonia. The first case in humans was reported in Denmark in 1968. Human infection with S. suis occurs sporadically in Europe and North-America and case reports suggest that it is almost exclusively related to occupational exposure to pigs or pork products. Incidences of human infection with S. suis are greater in S.E. Asia and China. Meningitis is the most common presentation in humans, but septicaemia and endocarditis are also seen.

NAME        Periodontal diseases
DESCRIPTION During the early stages of the periodontal disease, saccharolytic, aerobic Streptococcus spp. and other bacteria adhere to and colonize the tooth enamel and root surface. This sets the stage for Fusobacterium nucleatum to coaggregate with these early colonizers and to permit late colonizers, including dental pathogens, to eventually form a biofilm. These complex interactions result in the release of factors that lead to tooth decay. Physical interaction is very specific among various genera in this complex microbial community. Due to the unusual length, adhesive nature, and other cell surface properties of F. nucleatum, periodontal disease-causing bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, and Streptococcus spp. aggregate and thrive; hence, F. nucleatum is thought of as a 'bridge bacterium'.

NAME        Anaerobic infection
DESCRIPTION Anaerobic infections are common and some are serious with a high mortality rate. The clinically important anaerobes are several genera of Gram-negative rods (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Bilophila). Among the Gram-positive anaerobes, there are cocci (primarily Peptostreptococcus) and sporeforming (Clostridium) and non-sporeforming bacilli (especially Actinomyces and Propionibacterium). In terms of frequency, there are four major sites of anaerobic infection - pleuropulmonary, intra-abdominal, female genital tract, and skin and soft tissue infections (with or without involvement of underlying bone). Infectious diseases caused by these anaerobes include following symptoms, bacteremia, brain abscess, neck space infections and infections following head and neck surgery, chronic sinusitis and otitis media, dental and oral infections, pleuropulmonary infections, intra-abdominal infections, female genital tract infections, non-puerperal breast abscesses and diabetic foot ulcers.

NAME        Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS)
DESCRIPTION Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare condition defined by the combination of aplasia cutis congenita (ACC), characterized by scalp and skull lesions, and transverse limb abnormalities. Mutations in ARHGAP31 (AOS1), RBPJ (AOS3) and NOTCH1 (AOS5) cause autosomal dominant AOS.  Mutations in DOCK6 (AOS2) and EOGT (AOS4) result in autosomal recessive AOS.

NAME        Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
DESCRIPTION Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne systemic emerging haemorrhagic fever. The causative agent, SFTS virus (SFTSV), is a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and considerable changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has 10-15% mortality rate, commonly because of multiorgan dysfunction. No specific treatment of SFTS is available, and avoiding tick bites is an important measure to prevent the infection and transmission of SFTSV.

DESCRIPTION Acute encephalitis is a serious form of neurological disease caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. It is generally characterized by the acute onset of fever, altered mental status, new onset of focal neurological symptoms, and generalized or focal seizures. It can be produced by various etiologies, but viral infection and autoimmune disorders are the most common. Causes of acute viral encephalitis are herpes simplex virus, other herpes viruses, adenoviruses, influenza A, and so on. Mortality rates range between 7 % and 18 %, and severe disability has been reported in up to 56 % of survivors.

NAME        Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
DESCRIPTION Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe viral illness caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Since then, MERS-CoV has caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic cases imported in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the United States of America. MERS is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death among more than a third of those infected. Severe disease is usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of MERS.

DESCRIPTION Pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) is a syndrome attributed to human adenovirus B, particularly serotype 3, which causes small outbreaks, mainly among children. The syndrome may occur sporadically and can cause outbreaks in families and other closed populations. The main sources of infection are contaminated waters of swimming pools and water reservoirs. Acute onset of PCF comprises fever, pharyngitis, rhinitis, cervical adenopathies and bulbar and palpebral conjunctivitis with moderate follicular reaction which can last for 3-5 days. PCF associated ocular inflammation begins unilateral and generally becomes bilateral in the course of the disease.

DESCRIPTION Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a rapidly progressive and highly contagious viral disease characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes with subconjunctival hemorrhages, excessive tearing, and photophobia. A palpebral conjunctival follicular reaction, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and congestion are common. Symptoms start after an incubation period of 12 to 48 hours, and the clinical signs usually disappear in 1 to 2 weeks. Enterovirus 70 (EV70) and coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) have caused large outbreaks of AHC. The AHC epidemic had begun in 1969 in Ghana and spread across Africa to India and the Far East, with small outbreaks in Europe.

NAME        Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infection
DESCRIPTION Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common causative pathogen in community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs), including acute otitis media, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia. It is also a major cause of bacteremia. Pneumococcal antibiotic resistance towards different families of antibiotics, in particular, penicillin and the macrocodes, continues to be a much-debated issue. The main mechanism of resistance in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae involves the alteration of penicillin target proteins, the so-called penicillin binding protein (PBPs), which cause reduced affinities and/or binding capacities for the antibiotic molecule.

            Group A streptococcal tonsillitis;
            Group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis
DESCRIPTION Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an acute infection of the oropharynx and/or nasopharynx that is caused by group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Group A streptococcus is responsible for 5-15% of cases of pharyngitis in adults and 20-30% of cases in children, and is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis. The disorder is primarily a disease of children between 5 and 15 years of age, and, in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. The onset of symptoms in patients is often abrupt. In addition to throat pain, symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, headache, and particularly in younger children abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis are not typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, and, if present, they suggest an alternative cause such as a viral infection. In most persons, fever resolves within 3-5 days, and throat pain resolves within 1 week, even without specific treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of subsequent development of acute rheumatic fever and suppurative complications.

NAME        Lysosomal storage diseases
DESCRIPTION Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of inherited diseases that are characterised by the intracellular accumulation of incompletely degraded macromolecules. They result from a genetic defect in cellular transport or metabolism of molecules within the lysosome. Most of the patients with a LSD are born apparently healthy and the symptoms develop progressively. Treatment is directed toward symptomatic care of secondary complications for most of these diseases. For some individuals, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or enzyme-replacement therapy can be effective.
            LSDs are divided into the following 5 groups. For details, please refer to the each entry.
            1. Defects in glycan degradation: H00125 Fabry disease, H00421 Mucopolysaccharidosis, H00422 Glycoproteinoses, H00423 Defects in the degradation of sulfatide, H00426 Defects in the degradation of ganglioside, H00069 Pompe disease, H01239 Prosaposin deficiency
            2. Defects in lipid degradation: H00424 Defects in the degradation of sphingomyelin, H00148 Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency
            3. Defects in protein degradation: H00149 Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, H00425  Lysosomal cysteine protease deficiencies, H01113  Acid phosphatase deficiency
            4. Defects in lysosomal transporters: H00275 Cystinosis, H00147 Sialuria
            5. Defects in lysosomal trafficking: H00136 Niemann-Pick disease type C, H00143 Mucolipidosis II and III, H00144 Mucolipidosis IV, H00149 Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, H00150 Danon disease, H00166 Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, H00101 Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome

NAME        Invasive streptococcal disease
DESCRIPTION Invasive streptococcal disease is defined as an infection associated with group A Streptococcus pyogenes. Since the mid-1980s, there have been reports from around the world of an increase in the incidence, and associated morbidity and mortality. One of clinical presentations is group A streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, which is differentiated from other types of this disease by the occurrence of shock and multi-organ system failure early in the course of the infection. Another is necrotising fasciitis, characterized by extensive local necrosis of subcutaneous soft tissues and skin and the isolation of S. pyogenes from a normally sterile body site. The other is a group of infections characterized by the isolation of S. pyogenes from a normally sterile site in patients not meeting the criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or necrotising fasciitis. Recently, cases associated with group B, C and G Streptococcus have been reported but less frequent.

NAME        Mitochondrial diseases
DESCRIPTION Mitochondrial diseases are clinically heterogeneous group of disorders that arise as a result of dysfunction of the mitochondria. They can be caused by mutation of genes encoded by either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA. While some mitochondrial disorders only affect a single organ (e.g.H00068 Leber hereditary optic atrophy), most of them involve multiple organ systems and often present with prominent neurologic and myopathic features. Many individuals display a cluster of clinical features that fall into a discrete clinical syndrome, such as H01347 MELAS syndrome, H01354 Leigh syndrome, H01355 Kearns-Sayre syndrome, H01356 Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged-Red Fiber Disease, H01363 NARP syndrome. However, there are many cases do not fit neatly into one particular category. For example, mutations in POLG are associated with a variety of phenotypes. (see H01395 POLG related disorders)

NAME        Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)
DESCRIPTION Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal-inherited, skin and neurodegenerative disease in which exposure to sunlight can result in a high incidence of skin and mucous membrane cancer. XP is classified into eight genetic complementation groups by the present. In this inside, 7 groups from the XP-A group to the G group show the abnormality in nucleotide excision repair (NER). The symptoms of XP begin in early life. Severe sunburn and blistering occurs in a half of patients, and all show early extensive freckling. Cancer incidence for individuals with XP under 20 years of age is 2,000 times as high as incidence in the general population. Neurodegeneration can be correlated with mutations in specific XP genes (XPA, ERCC3, ERCC2 and ERCC5).

NAME        Aseptic meningitis
DESCRIPTION The term aseptic meningitis can be used broadly to include all types of meningitis with negative bacterial cultures from cerebrospinal fluid. Etiology of aseptic meningitis is very wide and includes both viral and non-viral infections, drugs, malignancy, and systemic illness. Viral meningitis constitutes the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and enteroviruses, including Coxsackie and ECHO viruses, account for more than half of all cases. Clinical manifestations include headache, fever, malaise, photophobia, and meningeal signs. Treatment is mostly supportive and includes analgesics, antipyretics, antiemetics, maintenance of fluid balance, and prevention and treatment of complications.

            Rotaviral enteritis [DS:H00975];
            Acute gastroenteropathy due to Norwalk agent [DS:H01323]
DESCRIPTION Viral gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and intestines caused by a variety of viruses. Rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus typically cause diarrhea in infants and young children, whereas the Norwalk group of viruses (and occasionally calicivirus and astrovirus) produces explosive epidemics of gastroenteritis associated with contaminated water and foods, in adults as well as school-age children. No effective treatments have been developed for viral gastroenteritis. Current efforts are targeted at the development of suitable vaccines and the implementation of infection control measures.

NAME        Cushing's syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cushing's syndrome is the manifestations induced by chronic exposure to glucocorticoid excess. It most commonly arises from iatrogenic causes, when glucocorticoids are given to treat inflammatory diseases. In contrast, spontaneous Cushing's syndrome is rare. It results from various causes that all have in common a chronic over-secretion of cortisol by the adrenals. Cases due to a pituitary adenoma are known as Cushing's disease. It is the most common cause of spontaneous Cushing's syndrome. Symptoms associated with this disease include weight gain, lethargy, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, acne, purplish skin striae, and hyperpigmentation. Problems such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension may be associated. Central obesity is the most common manifestation. Fat accumulates in the face and the supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat pads, resulting in a typical moon face and buffalo hump, which is most often accompanied by facial plethora.

            Chorea-acanthocytosis
DESCRIPTION Choreoacanthocytosis (CHAC) is a type of neuroacanthocytosis, a heterogeneous group of hereditary syndromes characterized by the association of neurologic abnormalities with acanthocytic red blood cells. This disease caused by a variety of mutations in the VPS13A gene. The inheritance is mainly autosomal recessive, although apparent sporadic and autosomal dominant instances are also known. VPS13A gene encodes the chorein protein, which is thought to have a role in the change of cellular structures. CHAC is characterized by involuntary movements, cognitive decline, behavioral changes, seizures, and polyneuropathy. Oral-lingual dystonia is a noticeable feature, often resulting in mouth or tongue lacerations. Symptoms typically begin between 20 and 40 years of age, but earlier and later onset occurs as well.

DESCRIPTION Budd-Chiari syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hepatic venous outflow obstruction at the hepatic veins or inferior vena cava.  Clinically, the disease is characterized by hepatomegaly, manifestations of portal hypertension, and sometimes rapidly deteriorating liver function. Factors that confer a predisposition to the development of the Budd-Chiari syndrome, including hypercoagulable states, both hereditary and acquired, and a variety of other causes, can be identified in about 75 percent of patients. The factor V Leiden mutation and V617F mutation in the JAK2 gene have been noted in patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome.

NAME        Congenital asplenia, including:
            Isolated congenital asplenia;
            Asplenia syndrome;
            Ivemark syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital asplenia is a rare developmental disorder that is characterized by the absence of a spleen at birth. The patients are prone to life-threatening bacterial infections. Isolated congenital asplenia has no other developmental defects. Mutations in the gene RPSA, which encodes ribosomal protein, cause more than half of the cases of isolated congenital asplenia. The mode of inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, though sporadic cases are also reported. Congenital asplenia often occurs in the context of a recognised malformation syndrome, called the Ivemark syndrome.

NAME        Guillain-Barre syndrome
DESCRIPTION Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyneuropathy characterized by progressive motor weakness of limbs with areflexia. This disease is usually triggered by an infection, which provokes immune-mediated nerve dysfunction. GBS can be subdivided into the classic acute demyelinating type, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Classic acute demyelinating type is designated acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), representing the great majority of cases in Europe and North America. A mutation in the PMP22 gene was identified in a family with AIDP. AMAN is the most prevalent form in China. The incidence of AMSAN is very low. The axonal forms of GBS are caused by certain autoimmune mechanisms, due to a molecular mimicry between antecedent bacterial infection (particularly Campylobacter jejuni) and human peripheral nerve gangliosides.

NAME        Neurofibromatosis type 1;
            Von Recklinghausen disease
DESCRIPTION Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations of NF1 gene on chromosome 17. The NF1 gene encodes a RAS GTPase-activating protein called neurofibromin. It is one of the most frequent human genetic diseases, with a prevalence of one case in 3000 births and there is no sex or racial predilection. NF1 is characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, and iris Lisch nodules. Learning disabilities are present in at least 50% of individuals with NF1. Less common but potentially more serious manifestations include plexiform neurofibromas, optic nerve and other central nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and vasculopathy.

NAME        Neurofibromatosis type 2
DESCRIPTION Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome that is caused by inactivating mutations of the NF2 tumour suppressor gene. The course of the disease is usually progressive, though variable, causing significant morbidity associated with deafness, blindness, brain stem compression, gait instability, and paralysis. Onset typically occurs while a patient is in their 20s. Vestibular schwannomas, usually bilateral, occur in more than 90% of adult patients and intracranial meningiomas occur in about 50% of patients.

DESCRIPTION Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, also known as Trench mouth, Vincent angina and Vincent's gingivitis is an acute bacterial infection of the gingiva caused by spirochetes, fusiform bacteria, or an overgrowth of normal oral flora. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, advancing age, impaired nutritional status, smoking or chewing tobacco, immunosuppression, preexisting gingivitis, extreme stress, or lack of sleep. If the symptom progresses, the periodontium may be destroyed. Possible systemic manifestations include fever, anorexia, weakness, and fatigue.

NAME        Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection
DESCRIPTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections, ranking third among gram-negative bacteria, after Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Intrinsic resistance has been traditionally attributed to the low permeability of cellular envelopes together with the presence of chromosomally-encoded detoxification systems such as multidrug efflux pumps or antibiotic inactivating enzymes. Some strains acquire increased resistance via the horizontal transfer of resistance determinants and mutations in chromosomal genes.

DESCRIPTION Septic arthritis is defined as a purulent infection in a joint cavity. The infection commonly reaches the joint in children by hematogenous spread or by direct extension of pathogenic bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type-b, and Group A Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Kingela kingae, Neisseria meningiditis and Salmonella spp. are the predominant anaerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. One of the most predominant aetiologic agent of septic arthritis in all age groups is Staphylococcus aureus. Also, Gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents.

NAME        Viridans group streptococcal infection
DESCRIPTION The viridans group streptococci (VGS), a heterogenous group of streptococcal species, are the predominant species of the human oral flora and commonly inhabit other areas of the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and female genital tracts. VGS are usually organisms of low virulence. However, VGS are a major cause of sepsis and pneumonia in neutropenic individuals, and an important cause of sepsis and meningitis in neonates. These organisms are also occasional pathogens in healthy children and adults, causing infections such as subacute endocarditis. Although VGS resistance to penicillin and the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) drugs is an evolving problem, several drugs remain uniformly active against the VGS. Thus far, VGS resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin remains extremely rare.

NAME        Acne vulgaris
DESCRIPTION Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinization, inflammation, and bacterial colonization of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest, and back by Propionibacterium acnes. P. acnes is a Gram-positive bacterium that forms part of the normal flora of the skin, oral cavity, large intestine, the conjunctiva and the external ear canal. Although P. acnes is primarily recognized for its role in acne, it's also famous as an opportunistic pathogen causing a range of postoperative and device-related infections.

NAME        Body Dysmorphic Disorder
DESCRIPTION Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric disorder in which individuals are preoccupied with imagined defects in their appearance, which are not noticeable or appear slight to others. It is characterized by time-consuming behaviors such as mirror gazing, comparing one's appearance with the appearance of others, excessive camouflaging to hide the defect, and seeking reassurance. Patients experience significant distress, disability, and functional impairment, often accompanied by depression and suicidality. There is some clinical and pathologic overlap between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and BDD such as obsessive thoughts and the performance of ritual behavior. Patients with BDD respond to treatment with serotonergic agents such as clomipramine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which suggests a dysfunction of central serotonergic neurotransmission as a possible etiological factor. A recent study suggests that cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) was more effective than treatment with medications.

NAME        Hoarding disorder
DESCRIPTION Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of the value others may attribute to these possessions. They accumulate a large number of possessions that often fill up or clutter active living areas of the home or workplace to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible. Previously, hoarding has been treated as a typical obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom, using first-line pharmacological and psychological treatments for OCD, however, the results have not been robust. Clinical trial evidence suggests that OCD patients with hoarding symptoms are less responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) than those without hoarding symptoms. On the other hand, hoarding and non-hoarding OCD patients fared equally well in one open trial of paroxetine.

NAME        Excoriation disorder;
            Skin picking disorder
DESCRIPTION Excoriation Disorder, also known as Skin Picking Disorder, is characterized by the repetitive and compulsive scratching or picking of skin, which causes tissue damage. Patients spend a significant amount of time each day picking their skin, that causes psychosocial impairment. Triggers to pick vary greatly. For example, stress, anxiety, boredom, and feeling tired or angry have all been reported as triggers. Co-occurring psychiatric conditions are common in this disease. The most commonly reported comorbid conditions are trichotillomania, substance dependence, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). So far, there is no clear neurobiological explanation for the etiology of this disease. Recent research showed bilateral abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex and abnormalities on the left temporoparietal junction. Another study has shown deficits in motor inhibition, which appears to be correlated with frontal cortex abnormalities. Furthermore, severity of excoriation disorder may be associated with higher levels of impulsivity. Treatment for this disease has largely focused on cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacology. Early psychosocial treatment studies provided evidence for skin picking reduction with habit reversal or acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy (AEBT). The data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) efficacy in this disease are not convincing, although some studies suggested that fluoxetine is effective. Tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, and the dopamine-blocking opioid antagonist have also been found to be effective for skin-picking.

NAME        Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
DESCRIPTION Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.

NAME        Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS)
DESCRIPTION Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is an autoimmune disorder presenting with obsessive compulsive disorder and/or tics. PANDAS is believed to be caused by antibodies generated in response to a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection in genetically susceptible individuals. PANDAS is defined by five diagnostic criteria: (1) the presence of OCD and/or a tic disorder, (2) prepubertal symptom onset, (3) an abrupt onset of symptoms that are episodic in severity, (4) a temporal association between symptom exacerbations and GAS infections, and (5) the presence of neurological abnormalities (e.g., choreiform movements) during exacerbations. It has been reported that antibiotics and immunomodulatory therapies (plasma exchange and IVIG) were effective in lessening of symptom severity.

NAME        Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder (OCRD)
DESCRIPTION Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder (OCRD) is a group of disorders that is characterized by having preoccupations (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Previously, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was grouped with the anxiety disorders. However, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) moved OCD into a new category, because much of the evidence suggests OCD and OC-spectrum disorders are distinct from other anxiety disorders. Although OCD and anxiety disorders often share core clinical feature, significant differences also exist in effective first-line pharmacological interventions. Patients with anxiety disorders respond to a wide range of pharmacological interventions. In contrast, patients with OCD do not respond to nonserotonergic agents. OCRD includes OCD, Trichotillomania, Hoarding disorder, Excoriation disorder, and Body dysmorphic disorder.
            The usual treatments of OCRD are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).

NAME        Colonic spirochetosis
DESCRIPTION Colonic spirochetosis (CS) is a disease caused by the Brachyspira genus, Brachyspira aalborgi and Brachyspira pilosicoli. B. pilosicoli induces disease in both humans and animals, whereas B. aalborgi affects only humans and higher primates. CS is a polymicrobial disease characterized by persistent intimate mucosal epithelial cell attachment of spirochetes alone or together with certain enterohepatic Helicobacter species. Symptoms in humans include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal cramps.

NAME        Diabetic nephropathy
DESCRIPTION Diabetic nephropathy (DN), also called diabetic kidney disease, is a microvascular complication of diabetes which induces dysfunction in various cell types of the kidney, ultimately leading to the renal failure. A clinical syndrome of DN is characterized by decreased Glomerular Filteration Rate (GFR), excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, thickening of the peripheral glomerular basement membrane, glomerular hypertrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, increased excretion of albumin and decreased creatinine clearance. Generally, DN is divided into five stages: (i) hyperfunction with raised GFR and increased kidney volume; (ii) normalbuminuria with the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and the expansion of the mesangial matrix; (iii) incipient DN with MAU (30-299 mg per day); (iv) overt DN with macroalbuminuria (>300 mg per day); (v) uremia with end-stage renal disease. It has been reported that angiotension-vonverting enzyme, vascular endothelial growth factor A and superoxide dismutase 2 are associated with DN.

NAME        Diabetic retinopathy
DESCRIPTION Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most common vascular complication of diabetes, is the leading cause of visual deficits and blindness around the world.  The development of DR is divided into two stages: in the early stages, also called as nonproliferative stage, it is asymptomatic because the signs are not visible to the eye. however, some defects including microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhaging, narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels can be seen by detection; in the second stage, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, where neovascularization appears at the back of the eye and extend into the vitreous of the eye, and these new blood vessels are fragile. If they leak blood, the bleeding causes shrinkage of the retina, leading to retinal detachment, and ultimately to blindness. It has been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor A, angiotensin-converting enzyme, paraoxonase, erythropoietin are associated with DR development and progression.

DESCRIPTION Mycobacteria species other than the obligate pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and Mycobacterium leprae are known as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) or atypical mycobacteria. NTM are normal inhabitants of soil and treated water. Although generally of low pathogenicity to humans, NTM can cause a wide range of clinical diseases, for instance, pulmonary disease is most frequent, followed by lymphadenitis in children, skin disease and other extrapulmonary or disseminated infections in the severely immunocompromised.

NAME        Diabetic neuropathy
DESCRIPTION Diabetic neuropathies (DNs) are nerve damaging disorders caused by diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy broadly comprise generalized symmetric polyneuropathies (acute sensory, chronic sensorimotor, autonomic) and asymmetric (focal and multifocal) neuropathies (cranial, truncal, focal-limb, proximal-motor, coexisting chronic inflammatory demyelinating), which affect all organs and system. Of all types, diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN), also called distal symmetric neuropathy, is the most typical form. Typical Symptoms vary from person to person, but may include numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness that typically starts in the feet and progresses up the legs. This pattern of neuropathy shows a progressive distal axonopathy. It has been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor A is associated with DNs development and progression.

DESCRIPTION West syndrome, or infantile spasms (IS), is an infantile epileptic encephalopathy characterized by at least two of the following features: (a) clusters of flexion or extension epileptic spasms, (b) interictal electroencephalographic pattern (hypsarrhythmia), and (c) intellectual or neurodevelopmental disabilities. Most cases present at peak age of onset between 3 and 7 months, with 90% of patients presenting in the first year. The etiology of West syndrome is varied, ranging from structural, metabolic, unknown etiologies or genetic causes. Approximately 50% of cases have a prenatal cause, which includes central nervous system malformations, intrauterine insults, neurocutaneous syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), metabolic disorders, and genetic syndromes such as Down's syndrome. The treatment options are hormonal therapy (adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH, glucocorticosteroids) or the GABA aminotransferase inhibitor vigabatrin.

NAME        POEMS syndrome;
            Crow-Fukase syndrome
DESCRIPTION POEMS syndrome, also called Crow-Fukase syndrome, is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome due to an underlying plasma cell neoplasm, characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes as its salient features. Major diagnostic criteria include sclerotic bone lesions, elevated serum or plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Castleman disease. The misdiagnosis is very common due to its rarity and complicated clinical manifestations. Recognition of the complex of clinical complications is the first step in effectively managing the disease. The pathogenesis  is not well understood. VEGF appears to play an important role in the disease and is especially useful for monitoring therapy, but it is not likely the sole factor driving the disease. The most commonly used therapies include alkylators and steroids, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, lenalidomide, and bortezomib.

NAME        Rapidly growing mycobacteria infection
DESCRIPTION Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are classified into 2 categories: slow-growing mycobacteria (SGM) and rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), based on interval to colony formation by subculture on solid media. More than 50 species of RGM have been identified, more than a third of which are opportunistic human pathogens. The most frequently encountered RGM that cause human infections are Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum (complex), Mycobacterium mucogenicum, and Mycobacterium neoaurum. RGM, generally of low virulence, are capable of causing a wide spectrum of infections. Many RGM species, well-known and recently described species, caused significant infections in patients with cancer, including catheter-related bacteremia, disseminated infection, bronchopulmonary infections, dermatitis, cellulitis, and others.

NAME        Mycosis fungoides
DESCRIPTION Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), which are a heterogeneous group of malignancies derived from skin-homing T cells. MF presents in the skin with erythematous patches, plaques, and less frequently, tumours. Although the aetiologies of MF are unknown, important insights have been gained in the immunological and genetic perturbations that are associated with these diseases.  Mutations in the p53, p15, p16, JunB, and PTEN genes generally occur in later-stage disease. Loss of normal apoptotic T-cell pathways has also been reported. Apoptosis is partly mediated by death receptors, notably Fas, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. Decreased and/or defective Fas expression by neoplastic T cells has been associated with advanced/aggressive disease and impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis.

NAME        Mantle cell lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and it accounts for about 6% of all NHL cases. Diagnosis is based on lymph node, bone marrow, or tissue morphology of centrocytic lymphocytes, small cell type, or blastoid variant cells. The molecular hallmark and putative initiating oncogenic event in MCL is the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation resulting in constitutional overexpression of cyclin D1 and cell cycle dysregulation in almost all cases. Clinically, MCL shows an aggressive clinical course with a continuous relapse pattern and a median survival of only 3-5 years. However, recently a subset of 15% long-term survivors has been identified with a rather indolent clinical course.

NAME        Large-vessel vasculitis (LVV), including:
            Giant cell arteritis (GCA);
            Takayasu arteritis (TAK)
DESCRIPTION Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) covers a spectrum of primary vasculitides predominantly affecting the aorta and its major branches. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) are the two main subtypes. GCA is the most common vasculitis affecting adults aged 50 years or more, while TAK is a rare vasculitis that affects younger individuals mainly under 40 years. Clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic to significant systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and symptoms that result from aortitis and high inflammatory markers; C-reactive protein (CRP); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy of LVV. Patients may develop predictable adverse effects from long-term glucocorticoid use.

NAME        Ulcerative colitis (UC)
DESCRIPTION Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) whose pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes influences from genes, the environment, and the gut microbiome. In UC the inflammatory is limited to the musoca of the colon and rectum. Clinically, the most common manifestation of UC may include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain. In most severe cases, patients may experience fever, weight loss, anemia, and the intestine can get distended, presenting deep ulceration and possibly intestinal perforation.The long-time duration of the disease increases a colorectal caner risk. UC is associated with a Th2 immune response. Recent genetic analyses have linked genes including interleukin 23 receptor, interleukin 10 and macrophage stimulating 1.

NAME        Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
DESCRIPTION Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive cholestatic liver disease characterised by destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts, eventually leading to fibrosis and potential cirrhosis. Patients are usually middle-aged women and presents in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The most common symptoms are pruritus. It is not clear what causes PBC. It may be relate to problems in the autoimmune mechanism. The increased risk of genetic predisposition and environmental factors (infectious or toxic agents) trigger the disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid is currently the only medicine approved for the treatment of the disease.

NAME        Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis;
            Churg-Strauss syndrome
DESCRIPTION Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic vasculitic disorder of unknown etiology that affects small-to-medium-size blood vessels. This disease has been called Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) for many years, and renamed eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in 2012. EGPA is characterized by asthma, hypereosinophilia, and extravascular eosinophilic granulomas. Clinically, three phases may be distinguished. The prodromal phase may persist for many years, consisting of asthma possibly associated with allergic rhinitis and often complicated by recurrent rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. The second phase is characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia or eosinophilic tissue infiltrates. The third phase is dominated by manifestations resulting from systemic vasculitis. Vasculitis commonly affects the skin, nerves, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. It can be serious and life-threatening. EGPA pathogenesis is not well known. The disease is probably the result of a complex interaction in which genetically and environmental factors lead to an inflammatory response whose principal players are eosinophils, T, and B lymphocytes. HLA-DRB1 and DRB4 alleles and IL10.2 haplotype of the IL-10 promoter gene are the most studied genetic determinants. A combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is still the gold standard for the treatment of severe cases, but the use of biological agents such as rituximab or mepolizumab seems to be a promising therapeutic alternative.

NAME        Short bowel syndrome (SBS)
DESCRIPTION Short bowel syndrome (SBS), also called short gut syndrome or simply short gut, is a malabsorption disorder. It typically occurs in people who lost at least half of their small intestine due to surgical resection for various disorders, including crohn's disease, volvulus, cancer, or significant damage (injury, trauma). In infants, necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common cause for surgical resection of the small intestines. Patients usually experience symptoms that include abdominal pain, diarrhea. The main treatment is nutritional support such as oral rehydration, parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, vitamin and mineral supplements, and special diet. Currently, a recombinant analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) teduglutide associated with the treatment for SBS has been reported to improve intestinal absorption.

NAME        Giant cell tumor of bone
DESCRIPTION Giant-cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a rare osteolytic tumor of the bone. Although classified as a benign tumor, GCTB is characterized by local aggressiveness and risk of local recurrence. Its name is derived from the numerous multinucleated giant cells found within the tumor, which are principally responsible for the extensive bone resorption that is characteristic of GCTB. However, the neoplastic components of GCTB are the spindle-like stromal cells, which produce RANKL that recruits monocytic osteoclast precursors from blood to the tumor, and stimulates differentiation into multinucleated giant cells. Recently, denosumab (RANKL inhibitor) has become a new treatment option for locally advanced GCTB.

NAME        Lymphangioma
DESCRIPTION Lymphangiomas are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system. The lesions consist of dilated endothelium-lined spaces that vary in size from microscopic channels (cavernous lymphangioma) to large cysts (cystic hygroma). Although histologically benign, these lesions may expand into surrounding tissues and/or infiltrate vital structures similar to malignancies, sometimes causing life-threatening complications. The etiology of lymphangioma is not certain. The presence of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific markers on the endothelial lining of lymphangiomas (e.g. the transcription factor Prox1) indicates that the neoplasm may result from transformed LECs and/or stromal cells. This transformation is modulated by VEGF-C, a specific lymphatic endothelial growth factor, and its receptor VEGFR-3.

NAME        Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis
DESCRIPTION Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is generally defined as infection with M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the first-line antibiotics for treating tuberculosis. Drug-resistant tuberculosis has reached new levels of concern because of the recent identification of strains that are resistant not only to rifampin and isoniazid but also to any fluoroquinolone and at least 1 of the second-line injectable agents (amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin); this type of drug-resistant tuberculosis has been designated extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.

DESCRIPTION Reactional states of leprosy are expressions of immunological disturbance and are generally divided into two variants: type 1 (Jopling's type I or reversal reaction) and type 2 (Jopling's type II reaction). Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL), the main symptom of a type-2 reaction in leprosy, is caused by a humoral immune response to Mycobacterium leprae. Patients with ENL become acutely sick with fever, malaise, and crops of painful erythematous nodules. Inflammation often affects other systems causing iritis, neuritis, myositis, lymphadenitis, arthritis, dactylitis, and orchitis.

            Lawrence syndrome
DESCRIPTION Acquired generalized lipodystrophy, also called the Lawrence syndrome, is one subtype of acquired lipodystrophy caused by autoimmune disease, panniculitis or idiopathic. The disorder appears during the childhood and adolescence. Clinically, loss of subcutaneous fat occurs highly variable, exclusively at the face and extremities including legs, palms and some soles. In rare cases, intraabdomianl fat and bone marrow fat may also be spared. Similarly to congential generalized lipodystrophy, people with the disorder usually appear severe hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Metreleptin, as a recombinant analog of human leptin, has been approved for the treatment for the disorder as well as diet.

NAME        Lipodystrophy ;
            Lipoatrophy
DESCRIPTION Lipodystrophies are a group of rare disorders characterized by selectively loss of fat tissue, which can be congential or acquired, and generalized or partial. People with the diseases more frequently appear severe metabolic abnormality including insulin resistance and its associated complications such as diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, polycystic ovaries, and acanthosis nigricans. Genetic predisposition to inherited lipodystrophies has been discovered. Compared with them, the causes of the acquired lipodystrophies are still unknown, but mainly related to autoimmune mechanism, medications or other unknown mechanisms.
            Lipodystrophy can be classified to the following subtypes.
            Genetic forms: H00419 Congential generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), H00420 Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL), H00665 Mandibuloacral dysplasia-associated lipodystrophy (MDAL)

NAME        Behcet Disease;
            Behcet Syndrome
DESCRIPTION Behcet disease is a multisystemic inflammatory disease characterized by relapsing episodes of oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, other skin lesions, and uveitis. It can also involve visceral organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and neurological systems. This disease is more common in countries along the ancient Silk Road, including Asia, Middle East, and Mediterranean. Although the etiology is still unknown, this disease is believed to be triggered by environmental factors such as microbial agents in individuals with a particular genetic background. The positive association of HLA-B51 was identified more than four decades ago, and has been confirmed in multiple populations. Recent genome-wide association study identifies variants in the MHC class I, IL10, and IL23R-IL12RB2 regions associated with Behcet disease.

DESCRIPTION Congenital short bowel syndrome (CSBS) is an inherited intestinal disorder occurring in newborns and infants. Affected babies typically present a shortened bowel (approximately 50 cm) compared with normal lenth rages from 190 to 280 cm. CSBS causes malabsorption and the most common symptoms including chronic diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss, thus leading to failure to thrive. Gene mutation in coxsakie and adenovirus receptor-like membrane protein (CLMP) has been reported to be associated with this disease.

NAME        Machado-Joseph disease;
            Spinocerebellar ataxia 3
DESCRIPTION Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), is one of the most common hereditary ataxias and is distributed worldwide. MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, involving predominantly the cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron and oculomotor systems. Minor, but more specific, features such as external progressive ophthalmoplegia (EPO), dystonia, intention fasciculation-like movements of facial and lingual muscles, as well as bulging eyes, may also be of major importance for the clinical diagnosis of MJD. The mean age at onset is around 40 years. MJD is associated with CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene. CAG repeat varies in size among affected persons. There is no effective treatment of ataxia. Case series and small controlled trials of several medications including antianxiolytics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics have shown limited efficacy.

NAME        Castleman disease
DESCRIPTION Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder with two primary subtypes that vary in presentation and course. Unicentric Castleman disease is localized and carries an excellent prognosis. Multicentric Castleman disease can be associated with HIV and human herpesvirus-8 and is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, anorexia, anemia, and cachexia. Castleman disease is unique in that dysregulated secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a central pathogenetic role, although the exact events precipitating the oversecretion of IL-6 are unknown. Recently, two antibody-based therapeutics targeting components of the IL-6/IL-6R complex have been approved for the treatment of Castleman disease. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor, and siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody specific for IL-6.

NAME        Idiopathic macular hole;
            Retinal Perforations
DESCRIPTION Idiopathic macular hole is a common cause of visual impairment in people in their sixth decade or older, with a higher prevalence in females. Although existing theories of macular hole pathogenesis are constantly being changed and refined, nearly all confirm the predominant role of the vitreous in their formation. Until 1991, it was considered an untreatable condition, but now interventions are carried out to close the hole and thereby improve the central visual defect. Initially, vitrectomy surgery with long-acting gas (SF6, C3F8) and postoperative face-down positioning for at least 1 week was the only option. However, nowadays, there are a number of possible treatment choices including ocriplasmin treatment.

NAME        Myelodysplastic syndrome
DESCRIPTION Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in low blood counts, and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Currently, there are a few FDA-approved drugs for treatment of MDS none of which are curative. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the only curative therapy. But many MDS patients have been ineligible for transplants, since the median age at diagnosis for MDS is 75 years. Sequencing of MDS genomes has identified mutations in genes implicated in RNA splicing, DNA modification, chromatin regulation, and cell signaling.

NAME        Infantile hemangioma
DESCRIPTION Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are neoplastic proliferations of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), characterized by a period of growth after birth, and eventual spontaneous involution. Forty percent of the lesions are associated with complications such as ulceration, bleeding, infection, pain, cardiac failure, airway compromise or eye impairment. Pathogenesis of IH is still shrouded in mystery even though various theories have been postulated to explain its origin. Recent studies provide strong evidence for the conclusion that the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Tumor Endothelial Marker 8  (TEM8) mutations represent risk factor mutations for hemangioma formation. In the proliferating phase, constitutive VEGFR2 signaling in ECs from hemangioma lesions affects downstream processes, including EC proliferation and migration, providing a mechanistic explanation for the rapid endothelial proliferation seen in hemangioma.

ENTRY       H01483                      Disease
NAME        Acromegaly
DESCRIPTION Acromegaly (ACM) is a disorder characterized by increased circulating GH and IGF-I (a GH-induced liver protein) levels that is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality. Patients with persistently elevated GH and IGF-I levels have an increased risk of multiple comorbidities, including left ventricular dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, arthritis, impaired glucose tolerance, and colonic polyps. Most cases of ACM occur as a result of a sporadic GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (PA). However, ACM can occur in a familial setting, either associated with other endocrine abnormalities or as an isolated disorder. Somatic activating mutations in the GNAS gene, which encodes for the Gs-alpha subunit of G-proteins, are found in up to 40% of sporadic GH-secreting PA. Familial ACM can occur in the context of rare inherited syndromes such as familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which is caused in 15-20% of cases by aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene germline mutations. Moreover, a recurrent mutation was found in GPR101 in some patients with non-familial ACM.

NAME        5q- syndrome
DESCRIPTION 5q- syndrome is a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia, atypical megakaryocytes, thrombocythemia, refractory anemia, and low risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with other types of MDS. The WHO has proposed diagnostic criteria for the 5q- syndrome, defining the syndrome as representing de novo MDS, with a 5q interstitial deletion between bands 31 and 33 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality, macrocytic anemia, less than 5% blasts in the peripheral blood, and a normal or increased platelet count. The 5q- syndrome is also unique because it shows a remarkable response to treatment with the lenalidomide. It has been suggested that the 5q- syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14) gene which maps to the commonly deleted region.

NAME        Multiple sclerosis
DESCRIPTION Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.

NAME        Neuromyelitis optica;
            Devic disease
DESCRIPTION Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's disease is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that selectively affects optic nerves and spinal cord. The etiology of NMO is unknown but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental factor, possibly an infection, in genetically susceptible individuals. The principal effector in NMO is the self-reactive, complement-activating anti-AQP4 antibody. AQP4 water channel is a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Anti-AQP4 antibody is sensitive and highly specific serum markers of autoimmune NMO. For many decades, NMO was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), but prognosis and optimal treatments differ. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities in acute settings. Corticosteroids exert global immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PLEX removes antibodies, complement, and cytokines from the blood. Besides, immunosuppressant agents interfering with the function of T and B cells have been shown to prevent disease relapses and reduce neurological disability in NMO.

ENTRY       H01492                      Disease
NAME        Systemic sclerosis;
            Systemic scleroderma
DESCRIPTION Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by fibrosis of the skin and major internal organs. The core symptoms of this disease are Raynaud's phenomenon, skin thickening, Nail-fold capillary, and serum autoantibody production. Systemic sclerosis can manifest as either the diffuse or the limited variant, distinguished by the degree and the extent of cutaneous sclerosis. A highly variable clinical course exists that spans from mild and subtle findings to aggressive life-threatening multisystem disease. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are present in more than 90% of patients, and these ANA react against various intracellular components. However, one patient rarely has two or more types of ANA. The particular ANA types are often indicative of clinical features, disease course and overall severity. At present, there is no treatment that has been proven to modify the overall disease course, but therapy that targets specific organ involvement early before irreversible damage occurs does improve both quality of life and survival. Although the precise pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown, the consensus is that it is triggered in genetically-susceptible individuals by exposure to specific environmental agents.

NAME        Localized Scleroderma;
            Morphea
DESCRIPTION Localized scleroderma, also known as morphea, is a rare fibrosing disorder of the skin and underlying tissues. Sclerosis is mainly limited to the skin, but subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and underlying muscles and bone may also be involved. It is generally differentiated from systemic scleroderma by the lack of Raynaud's phenomenon and visceral involvements. Localized scleroderma is classified into plaque morphea, generalized morphea, and linear scleroderma subtypes according to the clinical presentation and depth of tissue involvement. Localized scleroderma generally appears at any age, and onset at 20-50 years old is common, with the exception of the linear type, which often develops in childhood. Extracutaneous manifestations in morphea are not rare. The most common extracutaneous manifestations are arthralgia and myalgia. Neurologic manifestations and ocular complications are the most common in those children with head and neck involvement.

            SEMDJL-Leptodactylic or Hall type
DESCRIPTION Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia that consists of type 1 (SEMDJL1, SEMD-JL Beighton type) and type 2 (SEMDJL2, SEMD-leptodactylic or Hall type). SEMDJL1 is caused by mutation in the B3GALT6 gene. The individuals with SEMDJL1 show the characteristic vertebral abnormalities, ligamentous laxity that result in spinal misalignment and progressive severe kyphoscoliosis, thoracic asymmetry, and respiratory compromise resulting in early death. The individuals with SEMDJL2 was identified mutations in KIF22 as the cause of this diesease. Its characteristic manisfestation includes short stature, midface hypoplasia, generalized ligamentous laxity causing mild kyphoscoliosis and progressive genuvalgum.

DESCRIPTION Meniere disease is an inner ear disorder characterized by episodic vertigo attacks, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Prevailing theories on its pathogenesis point to endolymphatic hydrops as one derangement responsible for producing dysfunction within the cochlea and peripheral vestibular apparatus. Although the familial clustering and the geographical and racial differences in incidence suggest a certain role for genetic factors in the development of Meniere disease, no convincing evidence for an association with any gene exists, at present.

NAME        Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS)
DESCRIPTION Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS) is an autosomal recessive rare disorder that is caused by the mutations in the CHSY1 gene. CHSY1 encodes chondroitin synthase 1 involving in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate and perhaps affecting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. The loss-of-function mutations in the protein cause defects in multiple development processes. The major features include limb malformations, short stature, hearing loss, delayed motor and mental development,  facial dysmorphism and dental anomalies.

NAME        Sporotrichosis
DESCRIPTION Sporotrichosis is an endemic mycosis in tropical and subtropical areas caused by Sporothrix schenckii which is a common saprophyte of soil, decaying wood, hay and sphagnum moss. S. schenckii usually causes a mixed suppurative and granulomatous inflammatory reaction in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, frequently accompanied by microabscess and fibrosis. The most common symptom is cutaneous disease, which is classified into fixed and lymphocutaneous forms. Osteoarticular, pulmonary, mucosal, disseminated and systemic infections are less common and usually occur in immunosuppressed individuals.

NAME        Lupus nephritis
DESCRIPTION Lupus nephritis is a severe organ manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can affect up to 70% of the SLE population. In childhood SLE, nephritis is present in up to 90% of the cases. This disease is one of the most serious complications of SLE, with a high morbidity and mortality. Clinical manifestations of active lupus nephritis include proteinuria, active urinary sediments, and progressive renal dysfunction. It is initiated by the deposition of immunoglobulins and formation of immune complexes in the glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments of the kidney. There is emerging evidence that the interaction between anti-dsDNA antibodies and kidney cells, notably mesangial cells, proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, and glomerular endothelial cells plays a significant role in disease pathogenesis.

NAME        Sjogren's Syndrome
DESCRIPTION Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands leading to sicca symptoms of the eyes and mouth. Several systemic and extraglandular manifestations can develop, including fatigue, arthritis, and involvement of organs such as the skin, lungs, and kidneys. SS may occur as a primary disorder or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined as secondary SS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Salivary secretions from these patients exhibit elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines. This is accompanied by a reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow, which can lead to infections, progressive caries, dysphagia and oral pain. Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time. Initially, HLA haplotypes were shown to be associated with primary SS. Recently, polymorphisms in the genes IRF5 and STAT4 have been convincingly identified and replicated in several studies as susceptibility factors.

DESCRIPTION Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKHS), initially described as an uveomeningoencephalitic syndrome, is a rare systemic autoimmune disease that targets melanocyte-rich tissues, such as the eye, inner ear, meninges, skin and hair. This disease is characterized by panuveitis, often associated with neurologic and cutaneous manifestations, including headache, hearing loss, vitiligo, and poliosis. VKHS is more common in individuals of pigmented skin, such as Asians, Middle Easterners, Hispanics and Native Americans. Although the exact etiology of VKHS remains unclear, it has also been postulated that such an autoimmune response might be triggered by an infectious agent in a genetically susceptible individual. Several studies have demonstrated that HLA-DR4 is strongly associated with VKHD.

NAME        Inclusion body myositis
DESCRIPTION Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most frequent acquired myopathy after age 45. It is distinguished from other inflammatory myopathies by its selective pattern of muscle involvement and slowly progressive course, and by the combination of inflammatory and degenerative muscle pathology and multi-protein deposits in muscle tissue. It typically presents with chronic insidious proximal leg and/or distal arm asymmetric muscle weakness leading to recurrent falls and loss of dexterity. Creatine kinase (CK) is elevated in IBM and needle electromyography (EMG) mostly shows a chronic irritative myopathy. Muscle histopathology demonstrates endomysial inflammatory exudates surrounding and invading non-necrotic muscle fibers often times accompanied by rimmed vacuoles and protein deposits. IBM is refractory to all known immunosuppressive therapies. It has been shown in small short-term trials that individualised exercise programs can lead to improvement or maintenance of muscle strength and aerobic capacity.

DESCRIPTION Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency or portal systemic shunting. HE most commonly occurs in decompensated liver cirrhosis and incorporates a spectrum of manifestations that ranges from mild cognitive impairment to coma. Although its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, one of the main factors is thought to be ammonia. Apart from hyperammonemia, various other pathogenic mechanisms, such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) theory, the benzodiazepine theory, the manganese theory, and the theory of oxidative/nitrosative stress, have been implicated in the development of HE. The pharmacological treatments that are currently used in clinical practice are directed toward reducing the production and absorption of gut-derived ammonia.

The main clinical manifestations include inflammatory back pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and extra-skeletal manifestations, such as uveitis. Although the cause of SpA is unknown, it is generally accepted that SpA is a multifactorial disease. Genetics (such as HLA-B27), inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF), and more recently the IL-23/IL-17 cytokine pathway have links to pathogenesis. Biologic agents, particularly TNF blockers, are primary treatment options and have been shown to reduce symptomatic inflammation.

NAME        Salivary gland cancer
DESCRIPTION Salivary gland carcinomas are rare tumours representing about 0.5% of all malignancies and less than 5 % of all head and neck cancers. These are a heterogeneous group of tumors that include 24 histologically distinct tumor types. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in adults and children. The most common genetic alteration in MECs is a unique translocation t(11;19)(q21;p13) producing the MECT1-MAML2 fusion protein. This fusion transcript can activate transcription of targets in the Notch pathway. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression is present in a minority of MECs and is associated with higher rate of metastasis and worse overall survival. Recent studies have evaluated the epidermal growth factor receptor family including EGFR and HER2 as potential therapeutic targets.

NAME        Tonsillar cancer
DESCRIPTION Tonsillar cancer (TC) is the most common oropharyngeal cancer and tumours are mainly squamous cell carcinomas. Traditionally, risk factors for the development of TC include the use of alcohol and/or tobacco, however a significant proportion of new cases develop in young patients without these risk factors. Recent investigation suggests that human papilloma virus (HPV) may serve as an etiology in such cases and represent a unique risk factor in a sub-set of patients. Compared with HPV-negative TC, HPV-positive TC showed a strong association with p16 overexpression, and an inverse association with EGFR amplification. HPV-16 integration status was strongly associated with c-myc amplification and HIF-1a overexpression. HPV-16 integration could be directly related to tonsillar carcinogenesis initially in tonsillar crypts, followed by cell cycle aberration such as p16 overexpression related to the G1-S phase.

NAME        Malignant paraganglioma
DESCRIPTION Paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia and derive from neural crest cells. Malignancy is defined by presence of metastases, tumor spread in sites where chromaffin tissue is normally absent such as lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bones. Malignant PGLs are extremely rare. The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.

NAME        Mast-cell leukemia
DESCRIPTION Mast cell leukemia (MCL), the leukemic manifestation of systemic mastocytosis (SM), is characterized by leukemic expansion of immature mast cells (MCs) in the bone marrow (BM) and other internal organs; and a poor prognosis. Gain-of-function mutations in the proto-oncogene c-kit that induce constitutive kinase activity of its product, KIT protein, are characteristic of various neoplastic diseases including MCL. Downstream signaling pathways, including PI3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, are inappropriately activated, and this is believed to contribute to the abnormal proliferation and survival of these neoplastic cells. The reason why the prognosis of patients with MCL is mostly that MCs in these patients are largely resistant against conventional drugs and targeted drugs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed against KIT D816V such as PKC412 (midostaurin).

NAME        Langerhans cell histiocytosis
DESCRIPTION Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation of specialized cells with characteristics resembling antigen-presenting cells that reside in the skin and mucosa. Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology.

NAME        Retinoblastoma
DESCRIPTION The retinoblastoma is an eye tumor of childhood that arises in the retina and represents the most common intraocular malignancy of infancy and childhood. Tumor formation usually begins with mutation in both alleles of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene RB1, followed by a series of other genetic alterations that correlate with the clinical stage and pathologic findings of the tumor. In retinoblastoma, mutation of RB1 leads to dysfunction or absence of the Rb protein. These mutations promote tumour development by deregulating the E2F family of transcription factors leading to uncontrolled cell cycle progression.

NAME        Landau-Kleffner syndrome;
            Acquired epileptic aphasia
DESCRIPTION Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is an epileptic encephalopathy that usually manifests itself in children aged 3-8 years with previously normal development. All LKS patients have abnormal EEG that is compatible with the diagnosis of epilepsy, however, only 70% have clinical seizures. The main symptoms are acute or subacute aphasia with inability to recognise, process or interpret verbal and/or non-verbal sounds. Although the exact etiology of LKS remains unclear, families with mutations in the GRIN2A gene have been described, in which some members have LKS. Recent reports have implicated susceptibility genes (SRPX2, ELP4) to idiopathic focal epilepsies.

NAME        Adult onset Still's disease;
            Adult Still's disease
DESCRIPTION Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder. The disease manifestations are protean ranging from high fever, arthralgia, skin rash, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly accompanied by systemic manifestations. Complications of AOSD include transient pulmonary hypertension, macrophage activation syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and amyloidosis. Common laboratory abnormalities include neutrophilic leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated acute-phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin). The exact pathogenesis of AOSD is unknown. Several factors such as genetics, infectious (bacterial and viral) agents, and environmental factors have been thought to play a causative role. Although no familial trend has been reported in AOSD, some studies have reported an association between AOSD and gene polymorphism of HLA, IL-18, and MEFV. Recent advances have revealed a pivotal role of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 in disease pathogenesis. Treatment consists of anti-inflammatory medications. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy, and corticosteroid therapy and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are usually required.

NAME        Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES)
DESCRIPTION Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is a rare endocrinopathy caused by tumors of the pancreas and duodenum. These tumors, called gastrinomas, release gastrin to produce large amounts of acid that result in severe gastroesophageal peptic ulcer disease and diarrhea. Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss.  Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous. The cancer can be spread to other parts of the body, most commonly to regional lymph nodes and the liver. The treatment of the ZES includes surgical removal and medical management of gastric acid hypersecretion for the prevention of malignant transformation and  the genesis of complications.

NAME        Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
DESCRIPTION The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder, caused by mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene, and characterised by thrombocytopenia, small platelets, eczema, and recurrent infections associated with increased risk of autoimmunity and malignancy disorders. Recent research suggested that the WIPF1-encoded protein WIP binds to the region of WASP which is frequently mutated in patients with this disease, and WIP mutations themselves lead to an immunological disorder resembling Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

NAME        DiGeorge syndrome
DESCRIPTION DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is a primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by dysgenesis of the thymus and parathyroid glands, conotruncal cardiac anomalies, and other dysmorphic features. This syndrome is usually associated with hypocalcemia resulting from hypoparathyroidism. In most cases the initial symptom is tetany caused by hypocalcemia within 24-48 hours after birth, with symptoms by immune abnormality appearing later. Most patients with this syndrome have a genomic deletion of chromosome 22q11, including the DiGeorge critical region (DGCR). A small number of cases of DGS have defects in other chromosomes, notably 10p13. Approximately 17% of patients with the phenotypic features of this syndrome have no detectable genomic deletion.

NAME        22q11.2 deletion syndrome;
            DiGeorge/ Velo-Cardio-Facial syndrome;
            CATCH22
DESCRIPTION The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common microdeletion disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3000-6000 live births. Most of the patients show the common 3 Mb deletion, but proximal 1.5 Mb deletion and unusual deletions located outside the common deleted region, have been detected. Various syndromes have been associated with 22q11.2 deletion including DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), conotruncal anomaly face syndrome (CTAF), and isolated and familial forms of cardiovascular malformation. Microdeletions of 22q11.2 have been found in more than 90% of patients with DGS and over 85% of VCFS/ CTAF patients. In addition, several patients with Opitz-GBBB syndrome have been reported with microdeletions of 22q11. The variability in the clinical expression of this disease is extremely wide. Classical features include congenital heart disease, velopharyngeal insufficiency or cleft palate, facial anomalies, speech and learning disabilities, neonatal hypocalcemia, and T-cell immune deficit. Nevertheless, the spectrum of anomalies associated with 22q11.2 deletion is becoming wider and wider. Some cardiovascular abnormalities are relatively specific for the syndrome. An interruption of the aortic arch, type-B (IAA-B) is associated with deletion 22q11 in approximately 50% of cases. Other defects including tetralogy of Fallot, double outflow right ventricle, ventricular septal defect and an aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery are frequently found.

NAME        Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)
DESCRIPTION Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a polyneuropathy that is often disabling, with more than 50% of patients reported as having temporary disability, and about 10% eventually becoming persistently disabled. The core clinical features are a chronic progressive or relapsing and remitting, symmetrical, and sensory and motor polyradiculoneuropathy causing weakness of proximal and distal muscles. The etiology is suspected to be of autoimmune origin, and the diagnosis is typically based on clinical history, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, and pathologic examination. CIDP often responds to immune therapies including corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).

NAME        Avascular necrosis of femoral head;
            Osteonecrosis of the femoral head
DESCRIPTION Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) is one of the most common diseases of osteonecrosis that leads to destruction of the hip joint. Osteonecrosis is a pathological process in which cellular death in the bone constituents occurs because of decreased blood flow or an interruption in the blood supply. ANFH occurs mainly in young individuals between 30 and 50 years old. The clinical manifestations of ANFH, including pain on exertion, limping gait, and discrepancy in leg length, cause considerable disability. The etiology of ANFH is unknown, but previous studies have indicated that heritable thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis, alcohol intake, and steroid use are risk factors for ANFH. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a particular type of femoral head necrosis occurring in children. It is more common among boys, and bilateral involvement occurs in 8-24% of cases. The disease is usually diagnosed among children under age 14 years, with a peak onset between 5 and 8 years of age. There is delayed skeletal maturation and impaired growth. In addition to congenital abnormalities, LCPD is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the blood. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported that COL2A1 mutations are associated with this disease. Recent studies have suggested that an association exists between ANFH and genetic polymorphisms in the plasminogen activator inhibitor (SERPINE1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) genes.

DESCRIPTION Treponemal infections occurring in humans comprise venereal syphilis and the non-venereal endemic treponematoses. The non-venereal endemic treponematoses are yaws, pinta, and endemic syphilis. Pinta, also known as mal del pinto or carate, is the most benign of the endemic treponematoses since it affects only the skin. This mild disease is characterized solely by alterations in skin color. Pinta is still prevalent in remote rural regions in tropical Central and South America.

DESCRIPTION Treponemal infections occurring in humans comprise venereal syphilis and the non-venereal endemic treponematoses. The non-venereal endemic treponematoses are yaws, pinta, and bejel. Bejel, also known as endemic syphilis, is endemic in many parts of the world including Saudi Arabia. The disease usually occurs in patients living in primitive environments with low standard of hygiene. Clinical manifestations of bejel are divided into various stages. Patches on the mucous membranes, angular stomatitis, nonitchy skin eruptions, and generalized lymphadenopathy are the most important early manifestations. In the late stage, affection of skin, bones, and cartilage may lead to severe destruction, especially of the nose and palate.

NAME        Gout
DESCRIPTION Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness.  Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease. Epidemiology studies reported that the excessive intake of alcohol and purine rich food, which excessively produce uric acid, leads to accumulation of uric acid.

NAME        Japanese encephalitis
DESCRIPTION Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito borne zoonotic disease caused by JE virus (JEV) in eastern and southern Asia. Culex tritaeniorhynchus is the primary vector of the JE virus, although species such as Cx. gelidus, Cx. fuscocephala, and Cx. annulirostris are important secondary or regional vectors. JEV predominately affects the thalamus, anterior horns of the spinal cord, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. It mainly affects children under 15 and is mostly asymptomatic. JEV is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, mainly pigs and wading birds.

NAME        California encephalitis;
            La Crosse encephalitis
DESCRIPTION California encephalitis is caused primarily by La Crosse virus, the most pathogenic agent of the California encephalitis serogroup, family Bunyaviridae. Its vector and primary host, Ochlerotatus triseriatus (also known by the synonym Aedes triseriatus), the Eastern Treehole Mosquito, transmits the virus to humans. Arbovirus infections in humans are primarily central nervous system infections, but other clinical manifestations include febrile illness and fever with hemorrhagic diathesis.

NAME        Chikungunya fever
DESCRIPTION Chikungunya fever is an acute febrile illness associated with severe, often debilitating polyarthralgias. The disease is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arthropod-borne virus that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. CHIKV was first recognized as a human pathogen during the 1950s in Africa, and since then, cases have been identified in many countries in Africa and Asia. Since a re-emergence of CHIKV in 2004, the virus has spread into novel locations, such as Europe, and has led to millions of cases of disease throughout countries in and around the Indian Ocean. Symptomatic patients generally report an abrupt onset of disease characterised by high fever, polyarthralgia, backache, headache, and fatigue. Fever and characteristic clinical symptoms appear within 4-7 days. Polyarthralgia is reported in 87-98% of cases and represents the most characteristic symptom. In children, clinical manifestations of chikungunya fever appear to be quite specific. The main clinical characteristics in infants are the high prevalence of dermatological manifestations (hyperpigmentation, generalised erythema, maculopapular rash and vesicuobullous lesions) and neurological complications (encephalitis, seizures, meningeal syndrome or acute encephalopathy). Treatment for chikungunya fever is limited to supportive care, such as rest, fluids, antipyretics, and analgesics. Several drugs are known to be effective against CHIKV when tested in vitro, but no recognised antiviral treatment is currently available.

NAME        Argentine hemorrhagic fever
DESCRIPTION Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is a rodent-borne illness caused by Junin virus (JUNV, Arenaviridae). AHF is endemic to the humid pampas of Argentina. The known principal reservoir host of JUNV is Calomys musculinus. AHF can be divided into three distinct phases: prodromal, neurological-hemorrhagic, and convalescent. The prodromal phase includes non-specific symptoms such as fever (38-39 deg C), malaise and myalgia as well as petechiae on the soft palate and cutaneous petechiae. Around 20-30 percent of AHF cases progress to the neurologic-hemorrhagic phase of disease characterized by severe hemorrhagic or neurological manifestations and shock.

NAME        Bolivian hemorrhagic fever
DESCRIPTION Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF) is highly lethal viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Machupo virus (MACV) that is a member of the family Arenaviridae. Natural vector and reservoir for MACV is the large vesper mouse, Calomys callosus. BHF was first described in 1959 during outbreaks affecting isolated human communities in eastern Bolivia. Initial symptoms include headache, fever, arthralgia, and myalgia. In the later stages of this illness, patients may develop hemorrhagic manifestations including subconjunctival hemorrhage, epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, and hematuria, as well as neurological signs including tremor, seizures, and coma.

DESCRIPTION O'nyong-nyong fever is one of the mosquito-borne viral fevers. The disease is caused by o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), an alphavirus that is transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. ONNV has been involved in large scale epidemics in Africa. Although no fatalities occurred, the 1959-1962 epidemic involved more than two million cases. In 1996, ONNV was the cause of another epidemic in Uganda after an absence of 35 years. ONNV produces symptoms such as fever, althralgia, and rash that generally last for less than one week. Analgesics and/or NSAIDs remain the main treatment options for the symptoms of arthritogenic alphaviral disease.

DESCRIPTION Venezuelan equine fever is one of the mosquito-borne viral fevers. The disease is caused by Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus that is transmitted by Ochlerotatus mosquitoes. VEEV is the most important human and equine pathogen. VEEV has caused periodic outbreaks of febrile and neurological disease, primarily in Latin America. VEEV is also a highly developed biological weapon amenable to use in warfare or terrorism. In human VEEV infection the incubation period is usually 2-5 days. Symptoms appear abruptly, including malaise, fever, chills, and severe retro-orbital or occipital headache. Myalgia typically centers in the thighs and lumbar region of the back. Signs usually include leukopenia and tachycardia, and are frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms of central nervous system involvement include convulsions, somnolence, confusion, and photo-phobia. Acute disease usually subsides 4-6 days after onset, followed by asthenia of several weeks duration. Occasionally, illness is biphasic with recurrence 4-8 days after onset. A small proportion of human cases proceed to stupor and coma and are sometimes followed by death.

DESCRIPTION West Nile fever is one of the mosquito-borne viral fevers caused by West Nile virus (WNV). WNV is a neurotropic, flavivirus that is maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds, but can also infect and cause disease in horses and humans. However, approximately 80% of people who are infected will not show any symptoms. WNV is endemic in parts of Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and since 1999 has spread to North America, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean. Symptoms are of sudden onset and may include malaise, eye pain, headache, myalgia, gastro-intestinal discomfort and rash. A small percentage of cases may develop encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, and long-term neurological sequelae are common in more than 50% of these cases. Currently, no specific therapy or vaccine has been approved for use against WNV infection in humans.

NAME        Rift Valley fever
DESCRIPTION Rift Valley fever is one of the mosquito-borne viral fevers caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae. RVFV is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily affects ruminants but can also be lethal in humans. In humans, the disease is generally of short duration and presents clinically as a mild self-limiting illness. The incubation period is generally 3-6 days, after which a sometimes biphasic febrile period follows that may last for several days. Patients may suffer from general malaise including a feeling of nausea, profuse sweating, sensation of fullness over the liver, vertigo, constipation, severe headache and pain in the back, shoulders and legs and may experience photophobia. In a few cases (1-2%), the disease can be more serious with complications which may include acute hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, and hemorrhagic syndrome with high mortality. While outbreaks have traditionally occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, recent outbreaks in the Middle East have raised awareness of the potential of this virus to spread to Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

DESCRIPTION Bunyamwera fever is a febrile illness of humans in Africa caused by the Bunyamwera virus. Symptoms include febrile illness, headache, arthralgia, rash and infrequent central nervous system involvement. Bunyamwera virus is the prototype virus of the Orthobunyavirus genus as well as the Bunyaviridae family of arboviruses. Orthobunyavirus, is composed of over 150 viruses that infect humans and are transmitted by mosquitoes, midges and ticks from reservoir animals like rodents and livestock. Orthobunyaviruses were generally not associated with haemorrhagic symptoms until Ngari virus was implicated in haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in East Africa. Their potential to reassort and cause severe human disease has been suggested.

DESCRIPTION Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition characterized by mental retardation and distinctive facial appearance, is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA21). Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal malformation in newborns. Throughout the world, the overall prevalence of DS is 1 per 1,000 live births, although in recent years this figure has been increasing. Roughly 95% of cases of DS are due to the presence of an extra (third) copy of HSA21.  Most often, the non-disjunction event leading to DS occurs in maternal meiosis I. In about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21. In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line. DS occurs at a much higher incidence in older mothers. Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that age independent DNA hypo-methylation is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal segregation. Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain. A recent paper has suggested that RCAN1 and DYRK1A, localized in the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR) of HSA21, may have an impact on the development of multiple tissues.

NAME        Zika fever;
            Zika virus disease
DESCRIPTION Zika fever is one of the mosquito-borne viral fevers caused by Zika virus (ZIKV), genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. ZIKV is transmissible from human to human through bites of Aedes species. ZIKV was initially distinguished in rhesus monkeys in the Zika forest of Uganda throughout the period of a yellow fever study. No outbreak had been reported until 2007, when ZIKV spread further to the Pacific Island of Yap. In 2013, the second and largest outbreak occurred in French Polynesia. In 2015, ZIKV infection has been confirmed in 18 states of Brazil, and the geographical distribution of ZIKV has steadily broadened given the wide distribution of the mosquito vector. Clinical manifestations of infection include fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, arthralgia, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, rash, oedema, lymphadenopathy and diarrhoea. In most cases, the infection appeared mild and self-limiting, with a mean symptom duration of 3-6 days. Shock complications and haemorrhagic signs have not been reported. However, Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurologic complication, was reported. Clinical and epidemiological study showed that there is a link between microcephaly and of Zika virus. It has been reported that ZIKV-infected children, who were born to ZIKV-infected mothers during pregnancy, were found to have neonatal head circumferences below the 10th percentile.

NAME        Fallopian tube cancer
DESCRIPTION Fallopian tube cancer is a rare, aggressive gynecologic malignancy. Recent genetic and immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (SAC) involving the ovary likely arises from distal fallopian tube epithelium, indicating that some ovarian cancers develop in the fallopian tube and are then spread to the ovary. Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature). There is also some evidence that BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations and c-myc have a major role in tumorgenesis.

NAME        Merkel cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy that exhibits clinically aggressive features and is associated with a poor prognosis. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be a cause, and corresponds with the sites of these tumours, often on sun-exposed skin, mostly (94%) in the White population. UV light may exert local immunomodulating action as it decreases amount of epidermal T cells and Langerhans cells, inducing hapten tolerance. Additionally, UV- specific mutations in TP53 and Harvey (Ha)-RAS genes are present in some MCC cell lines. Recently, the polyomavirus group has been linked with MCC. The MCC polyomavirus (MCPyV) has been isolated from MCC tissue and thought to be present in up to 80% of MCC. Tumorigenesis likely is caused by a number of sequential steps from viral integration into host DNA, mutagenic events, and specific immune responses.

NAME        Meningioma
DESCRIPTION Meningiomas are the second-most common central nervous system tumor in adults. These tumors arise from arachnoid cells of the meninges, the covering layer of the brain. The majority of meningiomas tend to be benign, localized, and non-invasive. However, some meningiomas tend to be more aggressive with tendencies toward invasion of the surrounding brain, high propensity for recurrence, and in rare cases extracranial metastasis. Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is likely responsible for the initiation of more than half of all meningiomas and may cause a mesenchymal-like cytomorphology. Recently, novel mutations have been discovered in non-NF2 meningiomas. The somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas.

NAME        Hepatic angiosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Angiosarcoma represents 1 to 2% of soft tissue tumors. It originates from endothelial cells of small blood vessels and may affect a variety of organs, including the retroperitoneum, skeletal muscle, subcutis, liver, heart and breast. Primary hepatic angiosarcomas (HAS) are much rare tumors, with worse prognosis compared with other angiosarcomas. HAS has been found to be caused by occupational exposure to vinyl chloride (VC) monomer since 1970, and the number of VC-associated HAS cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. Exposure of VC connects with a series of mechanistic events leading to carcinogenic outcome; mutations of K-ras and p53 are also detected.

NAME        Parathyroid carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a highly aggressive endocrine tumor, with an annual incidence of less than 1 per million. Over 90% of patients present with excess parathyroid hormone (PTH), representing <1-5% of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. PC is associated with mutations in the HRPT2/CDC73 gene and with decreased parafibromin and calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) expression. Negative parafibromin staining together with a CDC73 gene mutation increases the likelihood of malignancy and also predicts the clinical outcome, namely local invasion and/or metastases and mortality. An increased mortality is predicted by either of these abnormality combined with down regulation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression.

NAME        Oropharyngeal cancer
DESCRIPTION Oropharyngeal cancer is a generic term that includes tumors arising within the anatomic confines of the posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, tonsillar region and posterior one-third (base) of the tongue. The vast majority of these tumors (>95%) includes squamous cell carcinomas of mucosal origin. Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) are traditionally categorized as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is now recognised as a causative agent in a subset of OPSCCs. HPV-driven OPSCC and tobacco- and alcohol-related OPSCC are biologically distinct entities. In the former, p53 and pRb are both inactivated at the protein level by, respectively, E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins. The majority of HPV-negative tumors, instead, harbor mutations in the TP53 gene, an increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number and higher EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

NAME        Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever (AHF)
DESCRIPTION Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever is severe, often fatal disease in humans caused by Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). AHFV is a newly described flavivirus first isolated in 1994-1995 from the Alkhumra district south of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Full genome sequencing has indicated that ALKV is a distinct variant of Kyasanur Forest disease virus. Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever is thought to be a zoonotic disease, and reservoir hosts may include camels and sheep. Suggested routes of transmission are contamination of a skin wound with blood of an infected vertebrate, bite of an infected tick, or drinking of unpasteurized, contaminated milk. Clinical features include fever, headache, malaise, arthralgia, anorexia, myalgia, backache, nausea and vomiting, chills, retro-orbital pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hemorrhagic manifestations, and central nervous system manifestations.

NAME        Chiari malformation;
            Arnold-Chiari syndrome
DESCRIPTION Chiari malformations, also known as Arnold-Chiari syndrome,  is a group of syndromes consisting of different kinds of pathologic conditions of the posterior fossa development. They are congenital in most cases, caused by structural defects in the brain spinal cord which may involve genetic mutations or lack of proper vitamins or nutrients in the maternal diet. Less frequently, Chiari malformations are acquired after birth. Causes of acquired Chiari malformations involve injuries, exposure to harmful substances, infections. More rarely, chronic subdural hematoma can be the cause of progressive caudal descent of the cerebellar tonsils. Chiari malformations were classified by Hans Chiari in 1891, into four groups. Chiari malformation type I (CM I), the most frequent of Chiari malformations, is characterized by the inferior displacement of cerebellar tonsillas through the foramen magnum. This leads to different symptoms and clinical features, such as headaches, syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. CM II is characterized by displacement of the parts of the inferior vermis, pons, and medulla oblongata together with elongation of the fourth ventricle. Most cases are associated with myelomeningocele. CM III is characterized by an occipital or cervical encephalocele along with the intracranial abnormalities seen with CM II malformation and a wide foramen magnum. It causes severe neurological defects. CM IV is characterized by marked cerebellar hypoplasia or aplasia.

            Trisomy 13
DESCRIPTION Patau syndrome, also known as trisomy 13, is a chromosomal disorder characterized by the severe clinical picture of multiple congenital anomalies. It is one of the least common autosomal trisomies among live births with an estimated prevalence of 1:12000 - 1:29000 in newborns. The major clinical findings include cryptorchidism, abnormal auricles, congenital heart defects, polydactyly, microphthalmia, and micrognathia. Median survival time for patients with trisomy 13 is between 7 and 10 days and it is reported that between 86% and 91% of live-born patients with Patau syndrome do not survive beyond 1 year of life. Survival beyond the first year has been associated with mosaicism.

NAME        HIV infection
DESCRIPTION The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.

DESCRIPTION Edwards syndrome, also known as trisomy 18, is a chromosomal disorder due to the presence of an extra chromosome 18, either full, mosaic trisomy, or partial trisomy 18q. This disease is the second-most common autosomal trisomy, after Down syndrome. The live born prevalence is estimated as 1/6,000-1/8,000, but the overall prevalence is higher (1/2500-1/2600) due to the high frequency of fetal loss and pregnancy termination after prenatal diagnosis. The main clinical features include prenatal growth deficiency, characteristic craniofacial features, distinctive hand posture, nail hypoplasia, short hallux, short sternum, and major malformations (particularly involving the heart). Approximately 50% of newborns survive beyond 1 week while more than 90% do not survive beyond 1 years of age.

DESCRIPTION Wernicke encephalopathy is a rare but serious neurological pathology due to a vitamin B1 deficiency. It is commonly associated with heavy alcohol consumption. Other clinical associations are with hyperemesis gravidarum, starvation, and prolonged intravenous feeding. Most patients present with the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. It can be associated with life-threatening complication like central pontine myelinolysis. When Wernicke encephalopathy is suspected, treatment with high-dose parenteral thiamine (vitamin B1) should be given. If it is not treated promptly or if treatment is inadequate it can lead to death or to the chronic memory disorder, Korsakoff syndrome. Recent studies have suggested that an association exists between Wernicke encephalopathy and genetic polymorphisms in the thiamine transporter (SLC19A2).

Beriberi has two major clinical manifestations, dry beriberi characterized by neurologic manifestations that include peripheral neuropathy and acute encephalopathy, and wet beriberi with cardiovascular involvement including high cardiac output heart failure. Rarely, a fulminant or pernicious variant, termed Shoshin beriberi may occur, and is characterized by cardiovascular collapse. Appropriate management of this form is mandatory since thiamine supplementation leads to rapid recovery while untreated forms are fatal.

DESCRIPTION The 3C syndrome, also known as Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome, is a rare, presumably autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by craniofacial, cerebellar, and cardiac anomalies. Cardiac manifestations include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, and other valvular anomalies. Central nervous system anomalies include Dandy-Walker malformation, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and enlargement of the cisterna magna. Craniofacial abnormalities seen are cleft palate, ocular coloboma, prominent occiput, low-set ears, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, depressed nasal bridge, and micrognathia. The phenotypic manifestations can vary and cardiac and cerebellar manifestations are not always present. A recent study identified homozygous sequence variants affecting the KIAA0196 gene, which encodes the WASH (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein and SCAR Homolog) complex protein strumpellin as causal to a form of 3C syndrome. Another study showed that a missense variant in CCDC22 is associated with a form of X-linked intellectual disability with features of 3C syndrome.

NAME        CHOPS syndrome
DESCRIPTION CHOPS syndrome is a congenital disorder involving multiple abnormalities. The symptoms include cognitive impairment, coarse facies, heart defects, obesity, pulmonary involvement, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia. The gain-of-function mutations in the AFF4 gene, encoding a critical component of the super elongation complex (SEC), cause CHOPS syndrome. While CHOPS syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome are clinically recognizable distinct entities there is some phenotypic overlap between these two diagnoses.

NAME        Autosomal dominant striatal degeneration (ADSD)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration (ADSD) is a rare autosomal-dominant movement disorder affecting the striatal part of the basal ganglia, with onset in the fourth to fifth decade. The main clinical features are mild, slowly progressive dysarthria and hypokinesia without any apparent reduction in life expectancy. Brain MRI shows distinctive lesions of the putamen and caudate nucleus appearing earlier than the onset of symptoms. Causal gene mutations are discovered in the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) genes.

DESCRIPTION Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS) is a rare autosomal-dominant multisystem disorder characterized by early and extreme aortic and valvular calcification, dental anomalies (early-onset periodontitis and root resorption), osteopenia, and acro-osteolysis. A gain-of-function mutation in interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), encoding melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), causes  SMS through dysregulation of the human innate immune response. DDX58 mutations cause atypical SMS manifesting with variable expression of glaucoma, aortic calcification, and skeletal abnormalities without dental anomalies.

NAME        Cole-Carpenter syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cole-Carpenter syndrome (CCS) is a severe bone fragility disorder that is characterized by frequent fractures, craniosynostosis, ocular proptosis, hydrocephalus, and distinctive facial features. CCS was first described in 1987 as a newly recognized type of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Despite its apparent extreme rarity, CCS is commonly classified as a separate OI-like disorder. CCS is caused by a specific de novo mutation in P4HB, the gene that encodes protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), that impairs the disulfide isomerase activity. Mutations in SEC24D, a gene encoding a component of the COPII complex machinery, have been reported to cause CCS as well.

DESCRIPTION Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) is a rare craniofacial malformation syndrome with predominant intraoral involvement consisting in diffuse gingival fibromatosis of early onset. Most cases are sporadic, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance with de novo mutations. The main clinical characteristics of ZLS are gingival enlargement, prominent nose and thick ears with soft cartilages, nail aplasia or hypoplasia, hypertrichosis, joint hyperextensibility, hepato(spleno)megaly, and intellectual disability with or without epilepsy. Mutations in KCNH1 and ATP6V1B2 account for a proportion of ZLS.

NAME        Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification;
            Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (BSPDC);
            Fahr's disease
DESCRIPTION Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), also known as Fahr disease, is an inherited neurological disorder characterized by symmetric calcification in the basal ganglia and other brain regions, a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, ataxia, dementia, psychosis, seizures and chronic headache, and normal serum levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone. The typical age at clinical onset is between 30 and 50 years, and most individuals affected with IBGC are asymptomatic during childhood and young adulthood. The diagnosis of IBGC generally relies on the visualization of bilateral calcification mainly in the basal ganglia by neuroimaging and the absence of metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic causes. Familial IBGC is genetically heterogeneous and typically transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. The mutations in SLC20A2 encoding type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2 (PiT-2) are a major cause of familial IBGC. Recently the mutations of PDGFRB encoding platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-beta, PDGFB encoding the PDGFR receptor-beta main ligand and XRP1 encoding a retroviral receptor have been reported to cause calcification in the brain.

DESCRIPTION Roifman syndrome is a multi-system disorder with a physical phenotype that includes B-cell immunodeficiency, intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, retinal dystrophy, and characteristic facial dysmorphism. Recently, whole-genome sequencing of Roifman syndrome patients have demonstrated that Roifman syndrome is caused by compound heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the minor spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene RNU4ATAC, which was already implicated in a severe congenital disorder, microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type I (MOPD1) [DS:H00993].

            Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD)
DESCRIPTION Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI) is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, characterised by radiolucent metaphyseal and vertebral lesions. Patients may exhibit varying degrees of neurological impairment including spasticity, developmental delay, and basal ganglia calcification. In addition, signs of autoimmune disease resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are commonly observed. Furthermore, patients may also suffer from recurrent infections. SPENCD is caused by biallelic mutations in ACP5, encoding tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Affected individuals displayed an absence of TRAP serum expression and, in keeping with autoimmune manifestations, increased levels of serum interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) and an upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

NAME        Essential tremor
DESCRIPTION Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disorder that is considered to be one of the most common adult-onset movement disorders. ET is typically characterized by rhythmic, involuntary shaking of one or more parts of the body, and occurs exclusively during voluntary movements (action tremor) or in positions against gravity (postural tremor). The phenotypic severity of ET is variable, as evidenced by the existence of both highly disabling and milder forms of the disease. There are three subtypes of ET, namely hereditary, sporadic, and senile, and most studies indicate that ET is a hereditary disorder in more than half of affected individuals (and presumably has autosomal-dominant inheritance). The diagnostic approach includes obtaining a history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. At present, there are no validated serologic, radiologic, or pathological markers.

NAME        Subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON)
DESCRIPTION Subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by poisoning due to over-dose and prolonged oral administration of clioquinol. SMON is characterized by subacute onset of sensory and motor disorders in the lower half of the body and visual impairment preceded by abdominal symptoms, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Despite clinical features mimicking infection or multiple sclerosis, the discovery of the green hairy tongue and the green urine in SMON patients aroused researchers' interest and thereby began solving the cause of SMON. The green color was derived from a chelate compound of clioquinol with ferric iron. A large number of SMON were observed throughout Japan, and the total number of cases reached nearly 10,000 by 1970. After the governmental ban on the use of clioquinol in September 1970, there was a dramatic disappearance of new case of SMON. However, in Japan, there are still more than 2500 SMON patients suffering from severe dysesthesia/paresthesia and ataxic paraplegia.

NAME        Congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases;
            Kunze-Riehm syndrome;
            Michelin tire baby syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases, also known as Michelin tire baby syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized folding of excess skin. This feature was first described in 1969, then subsequent reports described variable additional features, such as intellectual disability (ID), facial dysmorphism, and cardiac and genital anomalies. It has been reported that mutations in either MAPRE2 or TUBB underlie the genetic origin of this syndrome. MAPRE2 encodes a member of the microtubule end-binding family of proteins that bind to the guanosine triphosphate cap at growing microtubule plus ends, and TUBB encodes a beta-tubulin isotype that is expressed abundantly in the developing brain.

NAME        Vitamin C deficiency;
            Scurvy
DESCRIPTION Scurvy occurs because of reduced intake or absorption of vitamin C, which is characterized by bleeding gums, impaired wound healing, petechiae, perifollicular hemorrhage, anemia, arthralgia and joint effusions, fatigue, depression, and sudden death. It appears to result primarily from the decreased synthesis of collagen, a major protein in the body dependent on vitamin C for its biosynthesis. However, this role of vitamin C does not explain all of the manifestations associated with scurvy. At-risk groups include the poor (because of reduced access to groceries), food faddists, and individuals with purported allergies to multiple fruit and vegetable products. Other at-risk groups include persons with gastrointestinal disease (e.g. colitis), anatomical abnormalities, poor dentition, cancer patients on chemotherapy, patients on hemodialysis, and psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, or anorexia). Alcoholic persons represent one of the largest groups at risk for scurvy because they may have poorly balanced diets and because alcohol decreases the absorption of vitamin C. The diagnosis of scurvy is generally based on clinical features and dietary history, and there is rapid resolution of signs and symptoms after vitamin C supplementation.

NAME        IgA nephropathy;
            Berger disease
DESCRIPTION Primary IgA nephropathy is an immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis defined immunohistologically by the presence of glomerular IgA deposits accompanied by a variety of histopathologic lesions. It is known to be the most prevalent primary chronic glomerular disease worldwide. Because of the critical interaction between an intrinsic antigen (galactose-deficient IgA1) and circulating anti-glycan antibodies, IgA nephropathy can be considered an autoimmune disease. Since the features of IgA nephropathy identified by light microscopy are nonspecific, immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase studies demonstrating a predominant deposition of IgA are essential to establish a definitive diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. Genetic factors undoubtedly influence the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. Genomewide association studies have identified common susceptibility loci in the absence of a priori mechanistic hypotheses.

NAME        Pellagra
DESCRIPTION Pellagra is a remarkable chronic wasting disorder, the late stage of a severe cellular deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3). The classical triad of pellagra is dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia. Early symptoms include lassitude, weakness, loss of appetite, mild digestive disturbances and psychiatric distress. The dermatitis caused by pellagra is a bilaterally symmetrical eruption at cutaneous sites of solar exposure. It tends to be painful to touch during the acute phase and can eventually become so clinically striking that the patient may become ostracized.  Untreated pellagra results in death from multiorgan failure. Pellagra used to be a disease of epidemic proportions in the developed world. In the 18th century, it was linked with poverty and subsistence on nutritionally marginal corn-based diets. In the 1940s and 1950s, with expanded biochemical knowledge, pellagra was reformulated as a deficiency disease due to inadequate niacin and its amino acid precursor tryptophan.  It is currently seen in association with other conditions of chronic nutritional deficiencies, like alcoholism.

NAME        Hydroxykynureninuria;

            Kynureninase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Hydroxykynureninuria, also known as xanthurenic aciduria is autosomal recessive disorder of tryptophan metabolism. It is characterized by excessive output of xanthutrenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and kynurenine in urine. This disease is caused by homozygous mutation in the KYNU gene, which encodes kynureninase. Kynureninase is an enzyme in the catabolic pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Some of these deficiencies lead to pellagra or mild pellagra-like symptoms, while it was reported in some patients no symptom of niacin deficiency was observed. The different clinical outcomes could be explained by differences in the intake of niacin. The sufficient intake of niacin could prevent depletion in some patients despite their impaired niacin synthesis.

NAME        IgA vasculitis;
            Henoch-Schonlein purpura
DESCRIPTION Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common systemic small vessel vasculitis in childhood with clinical characteristics of non-thrombocytopenic palpable purpura, arthritis, and involvement of internal organs such as gastrointestine (GI) and kidney. HSP has been associated with a history of preceding infections, especially upper respiratory tract infection. In addition, other characteristics of HSP include the deposition of IgA and C3 in small vessel walls, polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration around the vessel and in vessel walls, and increased serum levels of IgA and proinflammatory cytokines at the acute stage. Combined, HSP is regarded as a specific immune-mediated entity induced by environmental factors, particularly infections. Clinically, since there are no disease-specific laboratory abnormalities, HSP is currently diagnosed based on symptoms and signs and histopathological findings. Treatment is supportive because HSP is usually self-limiting except for serious GI or renal involvement.

NAME        Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)
DESCRIPTION Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a relatively uncommon disorder caused by the increased destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) by anti-RBC autoantibodies with or without complement activation. AIHAs can be distinguished on the basis of the autoantibody Ig class and thermal characteristics, i.e. the optimal temperature of reaction with autologous erythrocytes, in warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease; CAD), and mixed forms, although atypical cases of difficult diagnostic classification are reported with increasing frequency. Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The diagnosis is usually simple, based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT).

NAME        Acquired pure red cell aplasia
DESCRIPTION Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare condition characterised by selective inhibition and the absence of red cell precursors in the bone marrow with consequent anaemia and reticulocytopenia in the presence of normal granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages. RPCA can be classified into congenital and acquired. Congenital PRCA is also known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia [DS:H00237] and is a disease of infancy and early childhood. The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-mediated disease. The therapeutic plan usually focuses on the sequential use of various immunosuppressive therapies until a remission is obtained.

NAME        Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
DESCRIPTION Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterised by the intravascular activation of coagulation with loss of localisation arising from different causes. It can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which if sufficiently severe, can produce organ dysfunction. DIC is not a disease entity on itself but is always associated to an underlying disease. The clinical conditions that may be associated with DIC include sepsis, trauma, malignancy, liver disease, obstetric disorders, envenomation, vascular anomalies, and major transfusion reactions. A diagnosis of DIC should be made only in the presence of a clinical condition (causative factor) supported by repeated laboratory tests for coagulation profile and clotting factors. Treatment of DIC is aimed at combating the underlying disorder followed by supportive management.

NAME        Cluster headache
DESCRIPTION Cluster headache (CH) is the commonest of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) characterized by attacks of severe, strictly unilateral pain, which is orbital, supraorbital, temporal, or in any combination of these sites, with duration of pain attacks of 15 to 180 min. The pain of CH is associated with ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, ptosis and/or eyelid edema, and/or restlessness or agitation. Headaches often recur at the same time each day during the cluster period, which can last for weeks to months. CH occurs more commonly in male patients (2.5:1 to 4.3:1 male to female) with an average age of onset in the third or fourth decade. The pathophysiology of CH is not fully understood, but may include a genetic component. Treatment focuses on avoiding triggers and includes abortive therapies, prophylaxis during the cluster period, and long-term treatment in patients with chronic CH. Evidence supports the use of supplemental oxygen, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan for acute treatment of episodic CH. Verapamil is used to treat chronic CH. More invasive treatments, including nerve stimulation and surgery, may be helpful in refractory cases.

NAME        Systemic primary carnitine deficiency
DESCRIPTION Systemic primary carnitine deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, hypoglycemic hypoketotic coma, and hyperammonemia. Carnitine plays essential roles in the transportation of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. This disease is caused by mutations in SLC22A5 that encodes the high-affinity sodium-dependent carnitine transporter, organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2). The hallmark of systemic primary carnitine deficiency is low concentrations of carnitine in plasma, with accumulation of lipid deposits and renal leakage of carnitine. The clinical symptoms are alleviated dramatically by oral administration of L-carnitine. However, if untreated, patients are precipitated into a crisis with cardiac arrest or Reye-like syndrome that includes acute encephalopathy and fatty degenerative liver failure.

NAME        Chronic eosinophilic leukemia
DESCRIPTION Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) is a chronic myeloproliferative disease of unknown etiology in which a clonal proliferation of eosinophilic precursors results in a persistently elevated number of eosinophils in blood, bone marrow or peripheral tissues. In most patients with CEL (about 60%), eosinophils display PDGFRA-fusion genes and related cytogenetic defects. The most commonly detected oncoprotein is FIP1L1/PDGFRA. FIP1L1-PDGFRA is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase, which is suggested to induce the proliferation of EoL-1 (The eosinophilic leukemia cell line) cells by inducing c-Myc expression at the mRNA level via ERK and JNK signaling pathways.

NAME        Gastrotintestinal stromal tumor
DESCRIPTION Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract, arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal, or their precursor stem cells. GISTs account for about 80% of gastrointestinal sarcomas, with a mean annual incidence of 10-15 per million. Nearly 50-70% of the clinically apparent tumors arise in the stomach, 20-30% arise in the small intestine, 5-15% in the large intestine, and less than 5% in other locations. The genetic basis of GIST growth is a mutation of the KIT or PDGFRA gene leading to constitutional activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is the driving force behind tumor development.

NAME        Medullary thyroid cancer
DESCRIPTION Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignant tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells and accounts for only <5% of thyroid cancers, but it causes a disproportionate number of thyroid cancer deaths due to its more aggressive clinical behavior compared with well-differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas. A subset of MTC cases is hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene. Somatic mutations in either RET or RAS are also present in most sporadic tumors. In MTC, RET mutations lead to substrate-independent dimerization of the receptor causing constitutive activation, unrestricted signaling, and ultimately, cancer.

NAME        Osteoporosis
DESCRIPTION Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene. Bisphosphonates, and in some patients denosumab, are first-line drugs for osteoporosis.

NAME        Myasthenia gravis
DESCRIPTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a defective transmission of nerve impulses to muscles leading to muscle weakness and fatigability. Some, but not all, muscles are affected and not necessarily symmetrically. Increased weakness with continued muscle activity represents a diagnostic clue for MG, but these clinical features can vary. MG is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated MG might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. The evolution of MG is unpredictable, but it is generally characterized by the occurrence of relapses, sometimes subsequent to remissions and a worsening trend. For 85% of MG patients, the maximum severity is reached within less than 3 years.

NAME        Cutaneous lupus erythematosus
DESCRIPTION Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is the skin-related form of lupus erythematosus (LE), with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and a variable course. CLE is a frequent finding in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can also exist as a single entity without associated systemic autoimmunity (LE-specific skin disease). Despite ongoing research into the cause of CLE, it remains unclear how CLE relates to SLE pathogenesis. LE-specific skin disease includes the subtypes of CLE such as acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). ACLE is characterized by malar rash or maculopapular eruption on sun exposed areas. SCLE characteristically presents as annular or psoriasiform plaques in a photo distribution. CCLE can be further divided into discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain LE (CLE), and LE tumidus (LET). The pathogenesis of CLE is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and abnormalities in the immune response. It has been reported that many genetic risk factors for CLE involve HLA or interferon-related pathways. Corticosteroids and antimalarials were considered as the most suitable and effective systemic drugs for CLE patients.

NAME        Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)
DESCRIPTION The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh). Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia. Besides oncological treatment in case of case of SCLC-LEMS, treatment is based on symptomatic and semi-specific immunosuppressive therapy.

NAME        Restless legs syndrome;
            Willis Ekbom disease
DESCRIPTION The restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis Ekbom disease is a neurologic disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs accompanied by an urge to move them (akathisia). These symptoms occur predominantly at rest and worsen at night, resulting in nocturnal insomnia and chronic sleep deprivation. The prevalence of RLS increases with age and appears to be higher among women than among men. RLS has a high familial aggregation. To date, several loci and genetic risk factors have been identified, but no causative gene mutation has been found. Standard medications for RLS are dopamine agonists and CACN alpha-2 delta blocker. A high prevalence of iron deficiency has been found among patients with RLS. It has been reported that treatment with oral iron supplements resulted in improvements in the severity of the symptoms in patients with a low serum ferritin level.

NAME        Addison's disease;
            Primary adrenal insufficiency;
            Hypoadrenocorticism
DESCRIPTION Primary adrenocortical insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is a rare but fatal endocrine disorder characterized by the progressive destruction of the adorenal cortex, resulting in insufficient production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens. Although tuberculosis remains a significant cause in developing countries, autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of Addison's disease in developed nations. The clinical manifestations before a life-threatening adrenal crisis (shock, hypotension, and volume depletion) are subtle and can include hyperpigmentation, fatigue, anorexia, orthostasis, nausea, muscle and joint pain, and salt craving. Symptoms are gradual and worsen over a period of years, making early diagnosis difficult. Treatment for Addison's disease consists of lifelong hormone therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.

NAME        Hypereosinophilic syndrome
DESCRIPTION Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by marked blood or tissue eosinophilia resulting in a wide variety of clinical manifestations. A number of HES subtypes, or variants, have recently been identified. The best characterized of the clonal molecular defects implicated in myeloproliferative variant HES is the 800-kb interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in the fusion of 2 distinct genes, Fip1-like 1 (FIP1L1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRA), leading to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase. PDGFR is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor and the fusion PDGFRA kinase has constitutive/unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The lymphocytic HES variant is associated with T-cell clones producing interleukin-5 (IL-5) and can evolve into lymphoma. While myeloproliferative and lymphocytic HES are well established and permit elimination of the term, idiopathic, to these varieties, most HES patients do not fall into these categories and are classified as complex.

NAME        Parkinsonian syndrome
DESCRIPTION Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) are multisystemic diseases that produce not only motor and cognitive function impairment, but also other disorders that require the intervention of specialists other than the neurologist. PS include idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and vascular Parkinsonism (VaP), among other rarer causes of parkinsonism. Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PS, especially in certain ethnic groups, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.

NAME        Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a lymphoid neoplasm characterized by a proliferation of large lymphoid cells, referred to as hallmark cells, with strong expression of CD30. The World Health Organization recognizes 3 entities: primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALCL, and, provisionally, ALK-negative ALCL.  pcALCL presents in the skin and, while it may involve locoregional lymph nodes, rarely disseminates. ALK-positive ALCL, by definition overexpresses an ALK-fusion gene, typically via t(2;5)(p23;35) which fuses the ALK gene on chromosome 2 with the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5,  resulting in a NPM-ALK chimeric protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. ALK-negative ALCLs lack ALK rearrangements and their genetic and clinical features are more variable. A subset of ALK-negative ALCLs has rearrangements at 6p25.3 involving DUSP22, a gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits T-cell receptor signaling. DUSP22 rearrangements also are seen in a subset of pcALCLs.

NAME        Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including:
            Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD);
            Erosive reflux disease (ERD)
DESCRIPTION Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).

NAME        Primary aldosteronism
DESCRIPTION Primary aldosteronism is a clinical syndrome characterized by excess secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. It is manifested by hypertension and hyporeninemia. In the past, hypokalemia was thought to be a mandatory finding in primary aldosteronism. However, later studies confirmed that most patients with primary aldosteronism are normokalemic. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism among nonselected hypertensive persons is between 5% and 13%, and it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. There are the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma, ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma, and familial hyperaldosteronism (type I and typeII) are unusual subtypes. Somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D have been described in APAs. Usually, adenomas are managed surgically and bilateral hyperplasia, medically.

NAME        Polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM)
DESCRIPTION Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.

NAME        Myelofibrosis
DESCRIPTION Myelofibrosis (MF), one of the three classic Philadelphia-chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is characterized by symptoms mainly derived from anemia and splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms and associated with a median survival around 6 years. Most MPN patients harbor an acquired mutation in the hemopoietic cells, the V617F mutation, located in the pseudokinase domain of the JAK2 gene. This mutation results in a gain of function, i.e., in the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which plays an important role in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the hemopoietic cells, as well as in the immune function. Besides, a minority of patients with MF (most of them negative for the JAK2 mutation) harbor other JAK-STAT-activating mutation, the MPL mutation, in the gene of the receptor of the thrombopoietin. Recently, mutations in the CALR gene have been described in 86% of cases with primary MF that are negative for JAK2 or MPL mutations. CALR mutation also showed cytokine independent growth of cells due to activation of STAT5 involved with the JAK-STAT pathway but its exact role in MPN remains to be clarified.

NAME        Polymyalgia rheumatica
DESCRIPTION Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a relatively common inflammatory rheumatic disease in people older than 50 years of age. PMR is a clinical condition defined as the presence of inflammatory pain in the limb girdles. Range of motion is decreased at the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and the neck and hip girdle may also be involved. These symptoms often persist for at least 1 month and are combined with incapacitating morning stiffness, a decline in general health, and an elevated acute-phase response. Onset of PMR symptoms may be acute or gradual. It is known that PMR patients share many pathogenetic features with giant cell arteritis (GCA). Despite the similarities in age of onset and some of the clinical manifestations, the relationship between GCA and PMR is not yet clearly established. One-third of PMR patients have systemic manifestations such as low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia, but these are often milder than systemic symptoms in GCA patients. PMR is a benign and highly steroid-sensitive disease that should resolve fully with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for 12-24 months, although one or two relapses may occur. The diagnosis of PMR is made primarily on clinical grounds and is bolstered by laboratory evidence of an acute-phase reaction. There is no single diagnostic test for PMR, but sets of diagnostic and classification criteria have been suggested by several groups of investigators.

NAME        Galactorrhea;
            Lactation suppression
DESCRIPTION Galactorrhea is a discharge of milk or a milk-like secretion from the breast in the absence of parturition or beyond six months' post-partum in a nonbreastfeeding woman. The condition is more common in women who are 20 to 35 years of age and in previously parous women. It is less common in children and nulligravid women. Galactorrhea also can occur in men. After infancy, galactorrhea usually is medication-induced. The most common pathologic cause of galactorrhea is a pituitary tumor. Other causes include hypothalamic and pituitary stalk lesions, neurogenic stimulation, thyroid disorders, and chronic renal failure. Tests for pregnancy, serum prolactin level and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and magnetic resonance imaging are important diagnostic tools that should be employed when clinically indicated. The decision to treat patients with galactorrhea is based on the serum prolactin level, the severity of galactorrhea, and the patient's fertility desires. Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice in most patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders. Medications causing hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued or replaced with a medication from a similar class with lower potential for causing hyperprolactinemia. For women who cannot breastfeed after childbirth for some reasons, various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been used to suppress lactation and relieve associated symptoms. Pharmacological options mainly involve dopamine agonist medications.

NAME        Cervical dystonia;
            Spasmodic torticollis
DESCRIPTION Cervical dystonia (CD), formerly referred to as spasmodic torticollis, is a condition characterized by simultaneous and sustained contractions of both agonist and antagonist muscles of the neck, which frequently result in abnormal movements or postures. CD is considered a form of primary adult-onset focal dystonia. The majority of patients complain of pain, which is not a common feature of other focal dystonias. Head rotation is common, but head tilt, neck extension, and flexionmay also occur, often in combination. The pathogenesis of primary CD is unclear. Patients with secondary CD may have an abnormal birth or developmental history, exposure to drugs known to cause dystonia (tardive dystonia), or neurological illness. Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BoNT), have been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated when used to treat CD, and are therefore recommended as first-line therapy by current treatment guidelines.

NAME        Insomnia
DESCRIPTION Insomnia is a common disorder with a prevalence of about 10% in the general population. The most common complaints related to insomnia are difficulty initiating sleep (sleep-onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep due to prolonged nocturnal awakenings (sleep-maintenance insomnia), early morning awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from lack of sleep. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants.

NAME        Clonorchiasis
DESCRIPTION Clonorchis sinensis, the most common human liver fluke, is endemic in East Asia, particularly in China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Korea. There are three hosts in the life cycle of C. sinensis including freshwater snails (the first intermediate hosts), Numerous species of freshwater fish (the second intermediate hosts), and human or carnivorous mammals (dog, pig, cat, wild cat, marten, badger, mink, weasel and rat). The human and animal reservoir hosts acquire the infection from the ingestion of raw fish containing infectious metacercariae. Clinical symptoms of this disease range from asymptomatic in light infections to serious symptoms, including marked gastrointestinal disturbances with a syndrome associated with biliary obstruction. Generally, chronic heavy infections cause damage to the bile duct epithelium, eliciting gastrointestinal symptoms, jaundice, cholangitis, biliary stones and possibly cholangiocarcinoma. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for clonorchiasis.

NAME        Alcohol dependence
DESCRIPTION Alcohol dependence (AD) is a chronic but often disease that includes problems in controlling one's drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol, continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems, having to drink more to get the same effect (physical dependence), or having withdrawal symptoms when one rapidly decreases or stops drinking. The contribution of genetic factors to the development of AD is high. The best classical candidate genes for AD are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both genes are involved in enzymatic degradation of alcohol. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that the most robust associations for AD have been with such enzyme genes, especially ALDH2 in East Asian populations and ADH1B in European American and African American populations.

NAME        Essential thrombocytosis
DESCRIPTION Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a group of clonal stem cell disorders with similarities at the phenotypic and molecular level. ET is characterized by an isolated thrombocytosis and overlaps clinically with polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The V617F mutation in the tyrosine pseudokinase region of the JAK2 gene is found in 50 - 60% of ET patients. This mutation produces an increased tyrosine kinase activity of JAK2, resulting in uncontrolled cellular growth in the hematopoietic compartment. Calreticulin (CALR) or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations occur in approximately 25%, and 3% of ET patients, respectively.

NAME        Follicular lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Follicular lymphoma (FL) is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular center B cells. FL is characterized by diffuse lymphoadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly, and less commonly other extranodal sites of involvement. The genetic hallmark of FL, the translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), results in the constitutive overexpression of the bcl 2 protein, which impairs the normal germinal centre apoptotic programme. Inactivating mutations of MLL2 are found in >80% of FL and interfere with the ability of MLL2 to activate gene transcription through H3K4 methylation. Mutations of other histone modifiers (CREBBP, EZH2, MEF2B, and EP300) are found in ;33%, 27%, 15%, and 9% of FL, respectively.

NAME        Multiple system atrophy, including:
            Striatonigral degeneration;
            Olivopontocerebellar atrophy;
            Shy-Drager syndrome
DESCRIPTION Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease characterized by autonomic failure in addition to various combinations of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal dysfunction. MSA encompasses striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Shy-Drager syndrome, which were originally described as independent clinicopathological entities. The coexistence was detected later, and these conditions were regarded as nosologically allied. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein fibrils in oligodendrocytes that form glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI), a neuropathological hallmark and central player in the pathogenesis of MSA.  Although MSA is widely considered to be a nongenetic disorder, genetic mutations of the COQ2 gene have been linked to MSA as identified in Japanese families.

NAME        Irritable bowel syndrome
DESCRIPTION Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and abnormal bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation. In IBS, there appears to be no organic substance or biochemical abnormality that can explain the symptoms. IBS can be classified into categories: constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M), and un-subtyped IBS. Anticholinergic drugs, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, high molecular weight polymers (polycarbophil calcium), gastrointestinal motility regulators, probiotics preparations, and laxatives are used in the treatment of IBS. However, they are not uniformly effective. Several studies of patients with IBS suggest that this disorder aggregates in families, and thus, appears potentially heritable. It has been reported that familial GUCY2C diarrhoea syndrome shares clinical characteristics with IBS-D.

NAME        Pituitary gigantism
DESCRIPTION Pituitary gigantism is very rare conditions resulting from excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH). Most cases are due to benign pituitary adenomas. Nonadenomatous GH excess is exceptional but occasionally occurs in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN1), Carney complex, or McCune-Albright syndrome. The clinical manifestations may include increased growth velocity with tall stature, enlargement of the hands and feet, excessive perspiration, coarsening of facial features, and headaches. It has been reported that duplication of GPR101 probably causes gigantism and acromegaly. Therapeutic modalities for the treatment of pituitary gigantism include surgery, medication and radiation.

NAME        Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)
DESCRIPTION Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a progressive disease characterised by raised pulmonary vascular resistance, which results in diminished right-heart function due to increased right ventricular afterload. PPH occurs most commonly in young and middle-aged women; mean survival from onset of symptoms is 2-3 years. Mutations in the type II bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor (BMPR)-II are now considered to be the genetic basis for familial PPH and ~30% of cases of sporadic PPH. BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and affect intracellular signalling via Smads and mitogen-activated protein kinases.  It has been shown that missense mutations of cysteine residues in the extracellular or kinase domain of BMPR2 result in intracellular localisation of the mutated receptor and negligible Smad signalling.

DESCRIPTION Raynaud syndrome (RS) is characterized by episodic digital ischemia induced by cold or emotional stress. Pathophysiologic mechanisms include temporary vasospasm and fixed digital artery obstruction. Although the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is unclear, alterations in activity of the peripheral adrenoceptor have been implicated, specifically an enhanced smooth muscle contraction due to overexpression or hyperactivity of postsynaptic alpha 2 receptors. RS can occur as an isolated entity, historically referred to as Raynaud disease or now primary RS, or in association with other conditions, most frequently the connective tissue diseases (eg, scleroderma [DS:H01492], systemic lupus erythematosus [DS:H00080], rheumatoid arthritis [DS:H00630], and Sjogren's syndrome [DS:H01502]), often referred to as Raynaud phenomenon or secondary RS. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, based on patient descriptions of skin changes. Therapy has been focused on the use of general vasodilation strategies.

NAME        Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
DESCRIPTION Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH.

NAME        Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
DESCRIPTION Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is classified as group 4 pulmonary hypertension (PH) by the World Health Organization. It is a rare, but underdiagnosed, complication of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting from occlusion of large pulmonary arteries with a fibrothrombotic material and in many cases, the development of a distal vessel arteriopathy that closely mimics pulmonary arterial hypertension.  While the pathogenesis of CTEPH is not entirely understood, the primary pathophysiology appears to be related to an initial thrombotic event followed by both inadequate thrombus resolution and secondary arteriopathy. Several risk factors for development of CTEPH have been found, including the size of the initial PE, splenectomy, chronic inflammatory conditions, and indwelling catheters and cardiac pacemaker leads. There is however an increased incidence of elevated factor VIII levels in CTEPH, and this finding persists after treatment. However, none of these findings explain the development of CTEPH in the majority of patients affected by this disease.

DESCRIPTION Herpes zoster (HZ) presents as a rash of 2-3 weeks duration in immunocompetent patients that is accompanied by moderate or severe pain. In some patients, pain does not resolve when the rash heals but continues for weeks and, sometimes, for months or years; this phenomenon is known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is the most troublesome side effect associated with HZ. Both gabapentin and pregabalin can reduce pain and improve sleep patterns in patients with PHN.

NAME        Buerger's disease;
            Thromboangiitis obliterans
DESCRIPTION Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a nonatherosclerotic, inflammatory disease that most commonly affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the upper and lower extremities. Cigarette smoking has been implicated as the main etiology of the disease. Although Buerger's disease has a worldwide distribution, it is more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East and classically develops in male smokers younger than 45 years. There may be a predisposition to development of Buerger's disease, although no gene has been identified to date. The most common symptom is pain at rest and claudication in the affected hands or feet. Other symptoms include cold insensitivity, diminished peripheral pulses, cyanosis, skin atrophy, and reduced hair growth. As the disease progresses, patients will develop ischemic ulcerations and eventually gangrene. Abstinence from smoking is the definitive treatment to prevent disease progression. Medical line of treatment with vasodilators, pentoxyfylline, and cilostazol may help improve pain-free walking distance but cannot prevent disease progression. Surgical treatment in form of revascularization and sympathectomy increases peripheral blood flow and decreases the rate of amputations. Newer therapy with prostaglandins, bosentan, and stem cell therapy has shown promising results.

NAME        Arteriosclerosis obliterans
DESCRIPTION Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is one of the most common peripheral vascular diseases that causes ischemic symptoms of the lower limbs. Symptoms include discomfort, numbness, intermittent claudication, or even gangrene and ulceration. The risk factors of ASO include age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and hyperhomocysteinemia. There are no definitive treatments for ASO. The efficacy of surgical treatment is not satisfactory, and medication is required to maintain the postoperative vascular patency. In order to relieve symptoms such as cold sensation and intermittent claudication, drug therapy such as antiplatelet therapy and vasodilatory drugs are useful in the treatment of some patients with ASO. Adsorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has also been applied for the treatment of ASO. At present, the diagnosis of ASO depends on several clinical tests, such as angiography, estimations of ankle/brachial index (ABI), and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), as well as the measurement of circulating hs-CRP levels. However, these examinations can only be detectable when ASO already developed, and there was no predictable markers for ASO in its earlier stages. Recent studies have reported that some micro RNAs could be serum markers for early-stage ASO.

DESCRIPTION Chronic arterial occlusive disease is a highly prevalent peripheral vascular disorder. This disease is caused by arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO), thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), primary arterial thrombosis, embolism and so on. Of these, ASO is the most frequently encountered. Although differing clinically and pathologically, these diseases are similar in that they cause ischemia of tissues. The symptoms of chronic occlusive arterial disease result from impairment of blood flow to the extremities. Intermittent claudication is the commonest and usually the earliest symptom.

NAME        Patent ductus arteriosus
DESCRIPTION Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common congenital heart defect with both inherited and acquired causes. The ductus arteriosus (DA) is a fetal specific vascular connection between the main pulmonary artery and the aorta. After birth, the DA normally closes within the first several days of life. If present after the age of 3 month, this condition is known as PDA. PDA can cause significant problems, especially in premature infants. It can be associated with an increased incidence of chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Clinicians may choose to treat the PDA in an attempt to minimize the risk of these complications. Prostaglandin inhibition using indomethacin or ibuprofen is the standard strategy to close the DA. Surgical closure of the DA is an alternative option. Autosomal dominant forms of PDA caused by mutation in the TFAP2B and PRDM6 gene has been reported. PDA has been reported in a few subjects with thoracic aortic aneurysm and rare genetic variants in MYH11 and ACTA2.

DESCRIPTION Acute heart failure (AHF) can be defined as a heterogeneous syndrome of signs and symptoms of new-onset or gradual/rapidly worsening heart failure (HF), requiring urgent therapy. Intrinsic cardiac abnormalities and comorbid conditions, including lung and renal disease, and sleep-disordered breathing, can contribute to the development of AHF. Factors triggering AHF may include ischemia, hypertension, arrhythmias, noncardiac comorbidities, and administered drugs, etc. Because of the poor clinical outcome and the relevant associated morbidity and mortality, it remains a major public health issue with a substantial socioeconomic burden.

NAME        Angina pectoris
DESCRIPTION Angina pectoris is defined as cardiac-induced pain arising from a lack of myocardial oxygen. "Angina" is used to describe clinical symptoms such as discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arms that are induced by physical exertion or emotional stress and subside with rest or treatment with nitroglycerin. Angina is clinically classified into stable angina (SA) and unstable angina (UA). SA is a chronic medical condition while UA is an acute coronary syndrome. Among the causes of angina pectoris, the most common is coronary artery disease (CAD). At the cellular level, angina pectoris is a result of increased myocardial oxygen demand or decreased myocardial oxygen supply.

NAME        High blood pressure;
            Hypertension
DESCRIPTION High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors. Understanding of the genetic architecture of traits has progressed in rare mendelian hypertensive phenotypes, such as Gordon's syndrome.

NAME        Peptic ulcer
DESCRIPTION Peptic ulcer is a common disorder of gastrointestinal system characterized by mucosal damage secondary to pepsin and gastric acid secretion. It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. Typical symptoms include episodic burning epigastric pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy. About 25 percent of patients with peptic ulcer have a serious complication such as hemorrhage, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction. Administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and endoscopic therapy control most bleeds.

NAME        Hyperlipidemia, including:
            Hyperlipoproteinemia;
            Hypercholesterolemia;
            Hypertriglyceridemia;
            Mixed dyslipidemia
DESCRIPTION Dyslipidemia is a condition characterized by either an increase or decrease in concentration of lipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and combined hyperlipidemia refer to elevations involving the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL), and both, respectively.

NAME        Fibromyalgia;
            Fibromyalgia syndrome
DESCRIPTION Fibromyalgia is a common and chronic pain disorder that predominantly affects women. It belongs to the group of rheumatic disorders of the soft tissues, and is characterised by widespread chronic pain, cognitive and affective disturbances and fatigue. The etiology and pathogenesis of fibromyalgia is uncertain. Genetic studies suggest an association with polymorphisms in serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways involved in pain transmission and modulation. The disease is likely expressed in the presence of environmental trigger, which lead to expression of multiple genes that amplify pain perception in the pain processing pathway. Although there is no ultimate cure for fibromyalgia, some medications can alleviate symptoms of the disease.

NAME        Hypertriglyceridemia
DESCRIPTION Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a condition with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in blood continuing to rise. HTG generally refers to an increase of plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and gender of a reference population. HTG has generally been classified as primary when a definite familial or inherited basis is suspected, whereas secondary HTG refers to cases where there coexist one or more identifiable secondary conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), alcohol consumption, various medications, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, etc. Genetic conditions with HTG include familial HTG (FHTG), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) [DS:H00153], and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) [DS:H00156]. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of HTG, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids. Each of these classes has limitations. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

NAME        Neuropathic pain;
            Neuralgia
DESCRIPTION Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system, and may be generated by either the peripheral or central nervous system, or both. It is especially problematic because of its severity, chronicity and resistance to simple analgesics. It may result from various causes including cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, diabetic neuropathy, cancer-related neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-related neuropathy, spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome type II, among others. Treatments are generally palliative and include conservative nonpharmacologic therapies, drugs and interventional therapies such as spinal cord stimulation. Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

NAME        Endometriosis
DESCRIPTION Endometriosis is defined as the growth of the endometrial glands and stroma at extra-uterine sites, which are most commonly implanted over and under visceral and peritoneal surfaces within the female pelvis but which can also be found in the connective tissue in the pelvis areas and, more rarely, in any anatomic district. It is a major cause of infertility, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain, mediated by marked pelvic inflammation. While retrograde menstruation is the most widely accepted cause, its pathogenesis and natural course are not fully understood. Endometriosis is known to be a estrogen-dependent disease, manifests during reproductive years.

NAME        Uterine leiomyoma;
            Fibroid
DESCRIPTION Uterine leiomyoma, also known as fibroid, is the most common benign neoplasm of the female genital tract. It is a discrete, round, firm, often multiple uterine tumor composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue. The findings derived from high-throughput sequencing combined with previous knowledge have led to an emerging molecular classification of leiomyomas, suggesting that there are several distinct pathogenic pathways involved in leiomyoma formation. The evidence points to at least 4 molecular subclasses: leiomyomas with MED12 mutation, FH inactivation, HMGA2 overexpression, and COL4A6-COL4A5 deletion. While it is thought that the initial events that trigger leiomyoma tumorigenesis involves somatic mutations, it is evident that the development and growth of leiomyoma are highly dependent on ovarian steroid hormones, in particular, progesterone.

NAME        Dry eye desease;
            Keratoconjunctivitis sicca
DESCRIPTION Dry eye disease (also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca) is multifactorial disease of the tears, lids, and ocular surface which can result in symptoms of discomfort and/or visual disturbance and/or tear film instability with the potential for damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level. Orally administered tetraycycline derivatives and omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids are also used.

NAME        Renal anemia
DESCRIPTION Renal anemia is one of the most frequent complications of chronic kidney disease. Anemia leads to a decrease in oxygen delivery to vital organs, which is initially compensated for by tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy, but eventually leads to the development of cardiovascular disease. Renal anemia is caused by the deficiency of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) due to renal dysfunction. EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that has the role of the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. Formerly, treatment options were essentially limited to blood transfusions and androgen therapy, with its risks. However, since the late 1980s, the availability of recombinant human erythropoietin has revolutionized the management of renal anemia, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are now the mostly widely used drugs.

DESCRIPTION Chilblains, or pernio, is a localized inflammatory lesion of the skin resulting from an abnormal response to cold. It is characterized by persistent purple or purple-red nodules on acral skin, most commonly the feet. Chilblains occurs most commonly among young women between the ages of 15 and 30 years but may occur among older individuals or children. Treatment of chilblains is focused on keeping the affected area warm, and occasionally using vasodilator agents.

NAME        Blepharitis
DESCRIPTION Blepharitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelids associated with itchiness, redness, flaking, and crusting. It is among the most common ocular conditions affecting both children and adults. The etiology is complex and not fully understood, but the general consensus is that bacteria and inflammation contribute to the pathology. Blepharitis can be classified into anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the eyelid skin and eyelash follicles and may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes. Anterior blepharitis has classically been associated with Staphylococcus infection and seborrheic dermatitis. Posterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the meibomian glands and their orifices and may be a result of or cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is one cause of posterior blepharitis but others include infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and rosacea. The diagnosis of blepharitis is almost always based on the history and clinical examination. Long-term management of symptoms may include daily eyelid cleansing routines and the use of therapeutic agents that reduce infection and inflammation. Recent clinical trials have shown that antibiotics and topical corticosteroids can produce significant improvement in signs and symptoms of blepharitis.

NAME        Hyperthyroidism;
            Thyrotoxicosis
DESCRIPTION Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.

NAME        Major depressive disorder
DESCRIPTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder mainly characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, and a high risk of suicide. Accumulated evidence suggests that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of MDD although the pathogenesis of MDD remains unknown. Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.

NAME        Subacute thyroiditis;
            Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis;
            De Quervain thyroiditis
DESCRIPTION Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), also called subacute granulomatous or de Quervain thyroiditis, is a spontaneously remitting, painful, inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, which is considered the most common cause of painful thyroiditis. It is an uncommon but important cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO). SAT is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and occurs concurrently with outbreaks of viral diseases (mumps, measles, influenza). However, the exact etiology is unknown. Clinically, it presents with acute onset of pain in the thyroid region. The pain may be exacerbated by turning the head or swallowing, and may radiate to the jaw, ear or chest. Common initial clinical features include low-grade fever, fatigue, and mild thyrotoxic manifestations. The physical examination, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated thyroglobulin level, and a depressed radioactive iodine uptake confirm the diagnosis. Therapy with antithyroid drugs is not indicated in patients with SAT because this disorder is caused by the release of preformed thyroid hormone rather than synthesis of new T3 and T4. Therapy with beta blockers may be indicated for the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally effective in reducing thyroid pain in patients with mild cases. Patients with more severe disease require a tapering dosage of prednisone given over two to four weeks.

NAME        Pemphigus
DESCRIPTION Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

NAME        Schizophrenia
DESCRIPTION Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.

ENTRY       H01650                      Disease
NAME        Pemphigoid
DESCRIPTION Pemphigoid diseases are group of autoimmune blistering disorders of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by autoantibodies directed against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction that clinically can manifest with urticarial lesions, tense blisters, and erosions which may involve the mucous membranes. Diseases in this group include bullous pemphigoid (BP), dermatitis herpetiformis, mucous membrane pemphigois, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, herpes gestationis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. BP is the most common acquired bullous autoimmune dermatosis disease. It is primarily a disease of the elderly with an equal incidence in men and women. The clinical characteristics are the formation of tense blisters and pruritic urticarial erythema. Histopathologically, subepidermal blister formation associated with eosinophil infiltration is commonly observed in BP. The main autoantigens targeted by BP autoantibodies are hemidesmosomal transmembrane collagen XVII (COL17, also known as BP180/BPAG2) and the intracytoplasmic plakin family protein BP230. Most of these antibodies belong to the immunoglobulin G class. Diagnosis of BP relies on the clinical and histological aspects, but the most reliable clues are given by direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Three types of drugs, with distinct mechanisms of action, are used to treat BP: anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs designed to reduce the production of pathogenic antibodies, and treatments that increase the elimination of pathogenic antibodies from the serum of patients, such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy and therapeutic plasma exchange.

NAME        Macular edema
DESCRIPTION Macular edema is a common feature of many diseases of the retina, such as intraocular inflammation (uveitis), central or branch retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy and following cataract extraction. It is characterized by a retinal thickening in the macular area due to the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Extracellular fluid accumulates in the intraretinal area or collects in the subretinal space. In more severe cases, it occurs as cystoid edema with the typical petaloid appearance, and is the leading cause of visual loss. New treatments for macular edema have emerged over the past decade, the most recent and efficacious of which have involved blockage of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by frequent intravitreal injection of pharmacologic agents.

NAME        Seborrheic dermatitis
DESCRIPTION Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory dermatological disorder. The characteristic symptoms include scaling, erythema, and itching, which occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons. Topical antifungal agents are the first-line therapy for acute and long-term treatment of SD of the face and body. Treatment includes over-the-counter shampoos and topical antifungals, calcineurin inhibitors, and corticosteroids.

NAME        Bipolar disorder;
            Manic depressive illness
DESCRIPTION Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.

NAME        Lichen planus
DESCRIPTION Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory and immune mediated skin disease with characteristic clinical and histopathologic features. The skin and oral mucosa are the most frequently involved areas. Other mucous membranes (including the genitalia, esophagus, and conjunctiva) and skin appendages (e.g., scalp hair and nails) can also be affected. The etiology and pathogenesis of LP remain unclear. An autoimmune reaction in which CD8+-T lymphocytes attack basal keratinocytes leading to apoptosis of the cells has been favored. Various potential triggers, e.g. viral or bacterial antigens, metal ions, drugs or physical factors, could initiate the autoimmune process. Nonetheless, the role of the individual trigger factors is controversial. There is a significant association between lichen planus and infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The diagnosis of LP is based on the clinical presentation and should be confirmed by biopsy, if suspected. Histopathology is often conclusive, but in vesiculobullous cutaneous LP or erosive oral LP, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies can be an integral step in differentiating between LP and other diseases. With few exceptions, all forms of LP are treated with the same measures. Depending on the severity of the findings, topical and systemic treatment options are available.

            Wegener's granulomatosis
DESCRIPTION Granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA) is an idiopathic, systemic inflammatory disease characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and pauci-immune small- vessel vasculitis of upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys. The discovery of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) as a marker associated with GPA focused attention on the potential pathogenic role of these antibodies. Although ANCAs have been described that recognise a variety of myeloid antigens, only antibodies that react with proteinase 3 (Pr3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have consistently been linked to vasculitis syndromes. Pr3-ANCA is the predominant autoantibody found in patients with GPA. The discovery of ANCA has made the diagnosis of this disease even more possible but there is almost always a need to confirm the diagnosis via histological examination of the lesional tissue.

NAME        Psoriasis
DESCRIPTION Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.

NAME        Nephrotic syndrome
DESCRIPTION Nephrotic syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by heavy proteinuria (more than 3.5 grams per day), hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Calcineurin inhibitors with/without intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT) constitute the standard treatment for SRNS. It has been reported that additional rituximab treatment combined with conventional MPT and immunosuppressive agents is a promising option.

NAME        Microscopic polyangiitis
DESCRIPTION Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an idiopathic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic vasculitis. MPA predominantly affects small-calibre blood vessels and is associated with the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). The association with ANCAs originally defined the group of ANCA-associated vasculitides, comprising granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) [DS:H01655], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) [DS:H01468], which have different frequencies of ANCA-positivity. ANCA in MPA are predominantly directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) but may, in a minority of patients, be directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Not all patients, however, have ANCA. MPA is clinically characterized by small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and the lungs but other organs may be involved as well. Renal involvement, which can be the only manifestation, is clinically apparent as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and histopathologically as pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis is mainly established by clinical manifestations, computed tomography (TC), ANCA antibody detection, and renal and pulmonary biopsy. The introduction of aggressive immunosuppressive treatment has substantially improved the prognosis. The standardized therapeutic regimen is based on cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Using this regimen, remission can be achieved in most of the patients. Rituximab may represent an important alternative to cyclophosphamide for patients who may not respond adequately to antimetabolite therapies.

NAME        Pityriasis rubra pilaris
DESCRIPTION Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a spectrum of rare chronic inflammatory disorders with papulosquamous eruptions of unknown cause.  The prototypical clinical characteristics of PRP are follicular hyperkeratotic papules on an erythematous base that can eventually coalesce to large red plaques. Its classification into five subgroups is based on age at onset, clinical course, morphologic features, and prognosis. More than 50% of patients are best classified as type I with adult-onset PRP. It is comprised of widespread, follicular papules and plaques and tends to clear spontaneously in 80% of patients in one to three years. Type II, which is the atypical adult subtype, tends to be more chronic and presents with areas of alopecia, eczematous patches, and a palmoplantar keratoderma. The classic juvenile type III is observed in only 10% of patients. It is similar clinically to type I but occurs in children and tends to remit in one year. Type IV, which is the circumscribed, juvenile subtype, presents with sharply-demarcated areas of follicular hyperkeratosis and erythema of the elbows and knees. An estimated 5% of children with PRP develop an atypical form classified as juvenile type V. Most familial cases that are published belong to this group. Recently, the designation of a new category of PRP (type VI) has been proposed that is characterized by the presence of HIV infection with different clinical features and a poorer prognosis. Treatment of PRP can be difficult, and no standardized approach has been established, although systemic retinoids are considered first-line therapy. Cyclosporin, methotrexate, and azathioprine are alternatives.

NAME        Pityriasis rosea
DESCRIPTION Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an acute exanthem, which prevalently affects children and young adults. The cause of PR is uncertain but epidemiological (seasonal variation and clustering in communities) and clinical features suggest an infective agent. Light and electron microscopy findings suggest infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6/7). HHV-6 and HHV-7 may also interact with each other, explaining recurrences and atypical presentations. PR is self limiting and resolves within one to three months. It typically starts with the development of a large erythematous scaly plaque also called the herald patch or mother patch on trunk or neck, which is followed by an eruption of multiple secondary small erythematous scaly lesions located predominantly on the trunk and following the lines of cleavage on the back (Christmas tree or inverted fir tree appearance). Collarette scaling is seen typically. The eruption is usually preceded by a prodrome of sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, fever, and arthralgia. A case of PR is diagnosed mainly on clinical grounds. A biopsy is needed in atypical cases, and it mainly helps in excluding other differentials rather than diagnosing PR as the histopathological examination in a case of PR is relatively nonspecific and resembles a subacute or chronic dermatitis. As PR is a self-limiting disorder, most patients just need to be counseled regarding the natural course of the disease instead of putting them on an aggressive treatment protocol. Most patients would just need emollients, antihistaminics, and sometimes topical steroids to control pruritus.

NAME        Xanthoma;
            Xanthomatosis
DESCRIPTION Xanthomas are benign and usually yellow plaques, papules, or nodules that develop in the cutis and subcutaneous tissue. They evolve as clusters of foam cells and favor the neck, upper trunk, flexural folds and periorbital region. The foam cells are formed from macrophages as a consequence of gradual intracellular accumulation of lipids taken up by specific receptors or by the mechanism of phagocytosis. They are seen in several lipidoses and are usually indicative of a derangement in lipoprotein metabolism, in particular familial hypercholesterolemia. Prevention of xanthomas goes hand in hand with the management of the underlying disorders of lipid metabolism. Normolipemic xanthomatosis may be seen in several rare conditions.

NAME        Generalized anxiety disorder;
            Anxiety neurosis
DESCRIPTION Generalized anxiety disorder is a persistent and common mental disorder. This disorder is twice as common in women than it is in men. The symptoms include generalised and persistent excessive anxiety and a combination of various psychological and somatic complaints, such as  threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, tension, palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder has a relapsing course, and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms. But in the short term and medium term, effective treatments include psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

NAME        Pustular psoriasis, including:
            Generalized pustular psoriasis;
            Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau;
            Pustulosis palmoplantaris
DESCRIPTION Pustular psoriasis is a form of psoriasis [DS:H01656] characterized by multiple tender sterile pustules with an underlying, blotchy, erythematous base. It has been classified into localized and generalized forms. Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is the development of extensive sterile pustules with widespread erythema. The von Zumbusch type often starts abruptly and can be associated with painful skin, fever, and chills. The disease course varies from a benign, chronic process to an acute life-threatening episode, and as such optimal treatment depends on severity. Diseases considered within the spectrum of GPP include: impetigo herpetiformis and childhood GPP. Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and palmoplantar pustulosis are two distinct forms of localized pustular psoriasis. Treatment should be governed by the extent of involvement and severity of disease. Acitretin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and infliximab are considered to be first-line therapies for those with GPP. Adalimumab, etanercept, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A are second-line modalities in this setting. Pustular psoriasis in children, in pregnant women, and in localized forms alter which agents are first-line modalities as concerns such as teratogenicity need to be factored into the decisionmaking for the individual patient.

NAME        Panic disorder
DESCRIPTION Panic disorder (PD) is a common type of anxiety disorder, characterized by unexpected and repeated panic attacks or fear of future panic attacks. It has a rapid onset and includes symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, sweating and shaking. Some physical illnesses (e.g. asthma) commonly occur with panic disorder, and certain lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) increase the risk for the disorder, but causal pathways are still unclear. In recent years, an association was found between panic symptoms and increased activity in the right frontal region of the brain. Genetic susceptibility factors also exist, but their exact nature and pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and several medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and benzodiazepines are effective for PD. Among these, SSRIs and SNRIs are considered to be first-line treatment agents because of their efficacy and favorable side effect profile.

NAME        Primary peritoneal carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Female primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) has the characteristic of diffuse involvement of the peritoneum by papillary carcinoma in the absence of an obvious primary site and grossly normal ovaries, or minimal involvement. It is histologically indistinguishable from primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and is diagnosed in the absence of another identifiable primary. Most reported PPC cases are primary peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (PPSPC), while peritoneal mixed epithelial carcinoma (MEC) and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT) are rarely reported. Germline BRCA1 mutations in 26% of PPSPC patients was detected. BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher overall incidence of p53 mutations than wildtype BRCA1 case subjects. It is suggested that p53 has a unique role in the development and progression of BRCA1-related PPSPC.

NAME        Angiosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Angiosarcomas are rare, generally aggressive, malignant mesenchymal tumours of vascular origin and constitute less than 1% of all sarcomas. Their most frequent site of origin is the head and neck, especially the scalp, of elderly men. Angiosarcomas are likely derived from vascular endothelial cells, possibly resulting from aberrant angiogenesis. Studies have shown relatively increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFr1-3) in human angiosarcoma. The most common gene mutation in angiosarcomas is KRAS as well as other RAS mutations. Activation of the RAS pathway is often tumorigenic. Although immortalised murine endothelial cells form benign haemangiomas in vivo, the addition of activated HRAS produces rapidly growing, poorly differentiated angiosarcomas.

NAME        Medulloblastoma
DESCRIPTION Medulloblastoma is the most common embryonal CNS tumor of childhood and is likely composed of biologically different subsets of tumors arising from stem and/or progenitor cells of the cerebellum. Recently, four distinct molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma have been identified [WNT (wingless), SHH (sonic hedgehog), Group 3, and Group 4]. Nearly all (90 %) of WNT patients have somatic missense mutations in CTNNB1 which promote protein stabilization. Alterations in SHH subgroup most often fall within the Shh signalling pathway. The most common are somatic or germline inactivating alterations or loss of PTCH1 and SUFU, or somatic missense mutations activating SMO. Group 3 tumors are characterized by MYC amplification resulting in high MYC mRNA expression levels compared with SHH and Group 4 tumors.The most frequently mutated somatic gene in Group 4 medulloblastoma is KDM6A, a histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase.

NAME        Neoplastic meningitis
DESCRIPTION Neoplastic meningitis (NM) is a diffuse dissemination of tumor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or leptomeninges. NM is reported in patients with solid tumours (carcinomatous meningitis), haematological malignancies (leukaemic or lymphomatous meningitis), or primary brain tumours. Malignant cells reach the CSF and meninges by direct invasion from tumors located near or within the central nervous system (CNS), or via the bloodstream or other pathways that contact the CNS. The molecular changes responsible for the development of NM are not well delineated, but it is likely that they involve changes in molecules responsible for tumor cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation.

NAME        Secondary hyperparathyroidism
DESCRIPTION Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and disturbances in mineral metabolism, mainly calcium and phosphorus. SHPT is generally caused by diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia in response to prolonged reduced levels of extracellular calcium from various secondary aetiologies. Although it is initially and adaptive response to a variety of stimuli resulting mainly in extracellular hypocalcaemia (vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, calcium malabsorption), long-standing SHPT may eventually develop into autonomous HPT (ie, tertiary HPT). Because SHPT is a compensatory mechanism of the parathyroid glands, it commonly resolves with normalization of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. After excluding reversible secondary aetiologies, first-line treatment of irreversible SHPT (often related to chronic kidney disease) mainly involves medical therapies.

NAME        Social anxiety disorder;
            Social phobia
DESCRIPTION Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. SAD is generally considered a chronic disorder and has its onset during early adolescence. It is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness and substance abuse. Patients with SAD have an extreme fear of being negatively evaluated in social situations and, as a result, avoid social events or endure them with excessive fear or anxiety. Although the etiology of SAD is not yet fully established, twin and family studies suggest that SAD is heritable. Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder. In addition, there is evidence from various studies, that the serotonin, and dopamine neurotransmitter systems mediate the symptoms of SAD. A range of effective cognitive behavioural and pharmacological treatments now exists. However, they don't work for the 30-40% of patients.

DESCRIPTION Neurosis is a class of functional mental disorders involving distress but neither delusions nor hallucinations, whereby behavior is not outside socially acceptable norms. The state of research on neurosis has moved towards looking at biological and genetic substrates or mechanisms underlying neurosis. The recent literature shows acceptance of common mental disorders such as Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), Panic disorder (PD), and Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), across cultures replacing neurotic disorder. Usage of the diagnosis of neurosis has been decreased, and replaced by newer categories in the current popular classificatory systems. In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), all disorders regarded as neurosis remained together but under the division of rubric 'neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders'. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), neurosis has been eliminated as a category.

NAME        Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), including:
            Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis;
            Still's disease
DESCRIPTION Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA  is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.

NAME        Palmoplantar keratoderma
DESCRIPTION Palmoplantar keratodermas (PPK) comprise a heterogeneous group of keratinization disorders with hyperkeratotic thickening of palms and soles. Sporadic or acquired forms of PPKs and hereditary forms exist. The causes of acquired PPK vary, and include exposure to certain chemicals, side effects of certain drugs, and metabolic disorders. There is as yet no cure for hereditary PPK. In patients with acquired PPK, the cause should be treated or eliminated, if possible. In both instances, optimized treatment can lead to a significant improvement in symptoms. Topical therapy with urea-based ointments improves the skin's absorption of moisture and has keratolytic effects. Topical vitamin D therapy is another option.

NAME        Ankylosing spondylitis;
            Bechterew's disease
DESCRIPTION Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression. The most frequently applied biological agents approved for AS are TNF alpha inhibitors. The IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab has been recently approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and AS.

NAME        Syringomyelia
DESCRIPTION Syringomyelia is a spinal disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord. Early symptoms include headache, altered pain and temperature sensation, and paresthesia. If fluid continues to enlarge the cyst, the syrinx has the potential to compress or destroy the affected portions of the spinal cord. Surgical intervention is typically recommended to treat this condition, although a successful procedure often is limited to providing minimal neurological improvement or simply halting the deterioration. The term syringomyelia describes many pathogenetically different disorders. A popular broad grouping is a classification based on the assumed pathogenesis and association with other disorders. It has been proposed to divide the disorder into three subgroups. (1) Syringomyelia as a result of changed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics related to hindbrain disorders, e.g. Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, arachnoiditis or osseous abnormalities. (2) Syringomyelia as a result of intramedullary tissue damage caused by haemorrhage or infarction. (3) Syringomyelia as a result of intramedullary tumour with secretory capabilities. Other proposed classifications are based on syrinx fluid composition, central canal communication between syrinx and the fourth ventricle, or the microanatomical localisation of the syrinx.

NAME        Normal pressure hydrocephalus
DESCRIPTION Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a progressive brain disease characterized by gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and dementia, and by ventricular enlargement in the absence of elevated intracranial pressure. NPH can be secondary to disease processes that cause inflammation of the arachnoid, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or meningitis. As many as half of patients with NPH have no identifiable risk factor, and it is called idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH). Although INPH is usually considered an acquired form of hydrocephalus because the onset of symptoms is not until late in life, it has been reported that a subset of patients with INPH may actually have congenital hydrocephalus. Symptoms can be alleviated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt.

NAME        Congenital hydrocephalus
DESCRIPTION Congenital hydrocephalus is a common birth defect in the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is characterized by ventricular dilatation. Although commonly considered a single disorder, hydrocephalus is a collection of a heterogeneous complex and multifactorial disorders. It may occur alone (non-syndromic) or as part of a syndrome with other anomalies. Almost 50% of all cases of hydrocephalus are congenital and these are usually associated with adverse neurological outcome. It is probably the consequence of abnormal brain development. Genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Molecular genetic studies have revealed that the responsible gene for X-linked human congenital hydrocephalus is encoding for L1CAM. Although the recurrence risk for congenital hydrocephalus excluding X-linked hydrocephalus is low, recently, a few genes for autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus have been identified. Besides genetic factors, many other factors influence the development of congenital hydrocephalus, such as congenital malformations, intracerebral hemorrhage, maternal alcohol use, infection, and X-ray radiation during pregnancy.

NAME        Dandy-Walker syndrome
DESCRIPTION Dandy-Walker syndrome (DWS) is a congenital brain malformation, characterized by posterior fossa cyst, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, cerebellar vermis dysgenesis, and an upwardly displaced tentorium. Patients often have motor deficits such as delayed motor development, hypotonia and ataxia. About half have mental retardation, and some have hydrocephalus. It has been suggested that heterozygous loss of ZIC1 and ZIC4 is the cause of this disease. Various managements of DWS have been reported from open excision of the cysts to CSF diversion. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) and cystoperitoneal (CP) shunt insertion are the most common choices in the treatment of DWS.

DESCRIPTION Intrahepatic lithiasis is very common disease in East Asia, characterized by the recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. The main clinical symptoms are abdominal pain, fever and jaundice. Pathologically, the intrahepatic ducts are dilated and contain soft, pigmented stones, mainly calcium bilirubinate stones. It is likely to lead to biliary cirrhosis and increase the risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Hence, the treatment of this disease is difficult but vital. Currently, various treatment options have been available, including liver resection, percutaneous approach, endoscopic approach and laser lithotripsy.

NAME        Chronic pancreatitis
DESCRIPTION Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas that will finally result in both exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Chronic pancreatitis develops gradually and worsens over time, resulting in permanent organ damage. It is usually caused by recurrent episodes of pancreatic necro-inflammation, leading to pancreatic atrophy and dysfunction. It manifests clinically as maldigestion, weight loss, abdominal pain and eventually diabetes. Six major etiologies for chronic pancreatitis have been identified, namely toxic-metabolic (to include alcohol), idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent and severe acute pancreatitis, and obstruction. Oral protease inhibitors are currently used as a medical treatment for chronic pancreatitis.

NAME        Acute pancreatitis
DESCRIPTION Acute pancreatitis ranges from a mild, self- limiting disease to a life-threatening condition with multiple organ failure. Abdominal pain is the predominant symptom. Nausea and vomiting may accompany the pain. Patients frequently have a low-grade fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol abuse and gallstones. The currently accepted pathogenic mechanism includes autodigestion and acute inflammation of the pancreas by the activation of proteases of the pancreas and acute inflammatory cells. Severe acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of organ failure persisting beyond 48 hour. Organ failure that develops during the early phase is set in motion by the activation of cytokine cascades resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although effective therapies for acute pancreatitis are still limited, protease inhibitors have been considered to be a potential treatment to inhibit the pancreatic inflammation.

NAME        Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)
DESCRIPTION The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is an endocrine disease, characterized by inappropriately concentrated urine, dilutional hyponatremia, and subsequent manifestations of various central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Though usually transient, SIADH may be chronic. It is often associated with drug use or a lesion in the central nervous system or lung. SIADH is divided into two categories. One is the ectopic ADH syndrome induced by abnormally secreted arginine vasopressin (ADH/AVP) from cancer cells. Another is the morbidity caused by inappropriately secreted ADH from the pituitary gland. In both situations of SIADH, ADH binds to vasopressin V2 receptors (V2Rs) in renal tubules and thereby increasing water reabsorption. SIADH is difficult to distinguish from cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), another cause of hyponatremia characterized by renal loss of sodium and decreases in extracellular fluid volume during intracranial disorders. SIADH occurs in the setting of euvolemia, without evidence of renal disease or thyroxine or cortisol deficiency. Treatment options for SIADH include fluid restriction, demeclocycline, urea, frusemide and saline infusion, all of which have their limitations. The introduction of the vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists has allowed clinicians to specifically target the underlying pathophysiology of SIADH.

NAME        Disorders of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion
DESCRIPTION Water imbalance is common among the critically ill. The excessive increases or decreases in body water can be lethal. There are numerous pathologic and iatrogenic causes for water imbalance, the most troublesome being disorders of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. ADH is also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP). The prime determinant of free water excretion is the regulation of urinary flow by circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma. Disorders of water metabolism can be divided into hyperosmolar disorders, in which there is a deficiency of body water relative to body solute, and hypo-osmolar disorders, in which there is an excess of body water relative to body solute. The classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus (DI), and the classical hypo-osmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). DI can result from either inadequate AVP secretion (central or neurogenic DI) or inadequate renal response to AVP (nephrogenic DI). On the other hand, the dilutional hyponatraemia of SIADH develops due to persistent detectable or elevated plasma AVP concentrations.

NAME        Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
DESCRIPTION Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disease of the liver characterized by cholestasis and bile duct fibrosis, leading to decreased quality of life, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation within an average of 12 years. The disease occurs in children and adults, and is closely linked with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most often ulcerative colitis (UC). The clinical presentation is variable. Typical symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort, fatigue, pruritus, and weight loss. The most frequent abnormal physical exam findings are jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The pathogenesis of PSC remains unclear but hypotheses include genetic factors lymphocyte recruitment and activation, portal bacteraemia, and bile salt toxicity. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is widely used for PSC patients and UDCA can lead to improvements in serum hepatobiliary enzymes. UDCA has been tested alone and in combination with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant agents. However, there is no medical treatment for PSC with enough evidence to show a delay in disease progression, and new therapy is needed.

NAME        Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
DESCRIPTION Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disorder with an etiology that remains unclear. The pathogenesis may be a result of alterations in immune tolerance, a genetic predisposition and environmental conditions, which in collaboration induce a T-cell-mediated attack on liver antigens, leading to necro-inflammation and liver damage. AIH has marked female predilection. AIH can present at all ages, but the two peak ages of incidence are in childhood or adolescence and at around 40 years of age. Trademark biochemical/serological characteristics of AIH are elevated aminotransferase levels, positivity for autoantibodies and increased IgG. A histological picture of interface hepatitis is typical of AIH. The value of immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids, alone or in combination with azathioprine, was well documented in numerous studies of AIH.

            Banti's syndrome
DESCRIPTION Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is a disorder generally classified as a noncirrhotic portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and is clinically characterized by portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. The principal pathologic changes of IPH are devastation of the intrahepatic terminal portal radicles with considerable portal fibrosis and secondary atrophy of the liver parenchyma that follows portal thrombosis. The incidence varies considerably with the country. In contrast to its high prevalence in India, IPH is comparatively a rare disorder in Western countries. Middle-aged women are more prone to IPH in Japan. IPH usually suggests a benign prognosis, but sometimes is complicated with severe hemorrhage due to ruptured esophageal varices, or massive splenomegaly. It is mainly managed by supportive treatment such as endoscopic, radiological and/or surgical management for esophageal varices and/or splenomegaly. The definite etiology of IPH is still uncertain, but there are several theories on the potential pathogenesis of IPH. These theories include immunological disorders, infections, and genetic variants.

COMMENT     Japanese study groups usually use the term of "IPH", whereas Indian researchers prefer to use the term non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis for the name of this disorder. Groups in Western countries have proposed terms such as nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), hepatoportal sclerosis, or Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension.

NAME        Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO);
            Extrahepatic portal venous obstruction
DESCRIPTION Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is a vascular disorder of liver characterized by obstruction and cavernomatous transformation of portal vein with or without the involvement of intrahepatic portal vein, splenic vein, or superior mesenteric vein. The most characteristic imaging manifestation is the formation of porto-portal collaterals that allow hepatopetal flow. Gradually there is organization and temporal evolution of thrombus with formation of portal collaterals termed "cavernoma" aiming to bypass the obstructed portal vein. Patients generally present in childhood with multiple episodes of variceal bleed and EHPVO is the predominant cause of paediatric portal hypertension (PHT) in developing countries.

NAME        Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
DESCRIPTION Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) or crescentic glomerulonephritis is a life-threatening disease that destroys kidneys over a period of days to weeks. Proliferation of epithelial cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells lead to glomerular crescent formation and disruption of the specialized microvascular network in the glomerulus. This causes hematuria, albuminuria and loss of renal function. From an immunopathologic standpoint, primary RPGN is divided into pauci-immune GN (PIGN), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM) GN, and immune complex GN. PIGN, the most common etiology of primary RPGN, refers to a necrotizing glomerulonephritis with few or no immune deposits by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Approximately 90% of patients with PICG have circulating ANCA antibodies, leading to the systemic small vessel vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide are the first-line treatment, but infection is the most common cause of death of RPGN patients. Several new treatment strategies, such as leukocytaphereis (LCAP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), have become available and these treatments have made it possible to treat high-risk RPGN patients without inducing serious immunosuppressive states.

DESCRIPTION Fisher syndrome is a variant of the Guillain- Barre syndrome (GBS) and its classical clinical triad consists of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. It is a relatively rare neurological disorder, accounting for approximately 5% of acute inflammatory polyneuropathies. This disease is an immune-mediated condition and specific anti-ganglioside antibodies, especially IgG anti-GQ1b antibodies, are found in over 80% of the patients. Campylobacter and Haemophilus influenzae have been reported as infectious agents prior to the onset of Fisher syndrome. It has been reported that the median period required for the disappearance of ataxia was about 1 month, without therapy.

NAME        Lichen sclerosus et atrophphicus (LSA)
DESCRIPTION Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is a chronic inflammatory dermatitis affecting primarily vulvar, perianal and perineal skin. Extragenital lichen sclerosus is most common on the neck, shoulders, and upper portion of the trunk. It is generally asymptomatic or is occasionally pruritic and presents as flat, white, polygonal papules and atrophic white plaques. It is primarily seen in postmenopausal women, but also men and children can be affected. The aetiology is not clearly established, although there is a strong association with autoimmune diseases. Morphoea may coexist with LSA. Standard treatment includes topical corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus. The association between LSA and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is confirmed and has been described chiefly in females. The risk of SCC of the vulva has been estimated to about 5% in women with LSA.

NAME        Renal angiomyolipoma
DESCRIPTION Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is one of the most common solid benign renal tumours,  composed of fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessels. About 80% of AMLs are sporadic and not associated with any genetic syndrome. Remaining cases are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The pathogenesis of TSC is thought to result from mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that encode the proteins tuberin and hamartin, respectively. These proteins interact with each other to form heterodimers, whose most important role is inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Loss of inhibition of mTORC1 leads to increased activation of this pathway and the formation of the lesions characteristic of TSC. Sporadic renal AML usually have mutations in TSC2, but not TSC1.

NAME        Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)
DESCRIPTION Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is the most common central nervous system tumor in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Although these lesions are generally benign and non-infiltrative, they commonly arise in the region of the foramen of Monro, where they can cause obstructive hydrocephalus and sudden death. TSC is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. These mutations lead to constitutive upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which affects many cellular processes involved in tumor growth. Clinical studies have demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors can induce regression of SEGA in patients with TSC, providing a viable alternative to surgical removal.

NAME        Eosinophilic fasciitis;
            Diffuse fasciitis
DESCRIPTION Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by symmetrical swelling and skin induration of the arms and/or legs, evolving into a scleroderma-like appearance, accompanied by peripheral blood eosinophilia. The disease is present almost equally in both sexes. The etiology of EF remains uncertain. Hematological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, as well as intense physical exertion, chemical compounds, drugs, solid neoplasms, and physical factors have been proposed as possible triggers and associated factors. Some researchers have proposed an aberrant immune response as the main pathogenetic mechanism. Some EF patients improve spontaneously without treatment, but in those who do not, glucocorticoids are the mainstay therapy. Methotrexate at low doses is probably the most favored second-line treatment, especially in patients with morphea-like skin lesions.

NAME        Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis;
            Lyell's syndrome
DESCRIPTION Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN. Systemic steroids and IVIG are used most frequently in medical treatment and treatment options including cyclosporine, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis are required more rarely.

NAME        Erythema multiforme
DESCRIPTION Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by "target" lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects. To date, their use has been limited to EM major, as EM minor is self-limited.

NAME        Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
DESCRIPTION Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a progressive, fatal neurologic disorder of childhood and early adolescence. It is caused by a persistent infection of the brain by an aberrant measles virus. Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine have reported beneficial results. However, there is no definitively effective treatment for SSPE.

NAME        Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
DESCRIPTION Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by a variety of clinical and immunological manifestations. The clinical hallmarks of this syndrome are thrombosisand poor obstetric outcomes in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. APS can occur within the context of several diseases, mainly autoimmune disorders, and is then called secondary APS. About 40% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have antiphospholipid antibodies, but less than 40% of them will eventually have thrombotic events. On the other hand, it may be also be present without any recognizable disease, or so-called primary APS. Pregnancy complications in APS, such as recurrent unexplained abortions, fetal loss, preeclampsia, and premature birth, have been attributed to placental thrombosis and infarcts, and management of these patients is based on attenuating the procoagulant state. Treatment with low-dose aspirin (LDA) and heparinoids has become a conventional option for pregnant women with APS. Possible future therapies for non-pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are statins, rituximab, and new anticoagulant drugs.

NAME        Giant cell arteritis;
            Temporal arteritis
DESCRIPTION Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events. Tocilizumab, a humanised antihuman IL-6 receptor antibody, has been used successfully in several reports as a treatment of GCA.

NAME        Isolated TSH deficiency
DESCRIPTION Isolated TSH deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, that cause congenital hypothyroidism. Patients were found to have homozygous splice site mutation in the TSH beta subunit gene. They show symptoms of severe mental and growth retardation that can be prevented by early administration of exogenous thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine replacement therapy is the treatment of choice. Concomitant corticotropin deficiency should be excluded prior to starting therapy in order to avoid an adrenal crisis.

NAME        Hypopituitarism
DESCRIPTION Hypopituitarism is a chronic endocrine illness, and is the partial or complete insufficiency of anterior pituitary hormone secretion. Anterior pituitary is composed of five cell types that secrete growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and corticotropin hormone (ACTH). Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism are variable, often insidious in onset and dependent on the degree and severity of hormone deficiency. However, it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. A variety of diseases may cause hypopituitarism and, accordingly, this disorder can be divided into two types depending on its cause. Primary hypopituitarism is caused by disorders of the pituitary gland itself and may be due to the loss, damage, or dysfunction of pituitary hormone-secreting cells. On the other hand, secondary hypopituitarism is the result of diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk interrupting the nerve or vascular connections to the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the secretion of the pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism can be easily diagnosed by measuring basal pituitary and target hormone levels. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. The most common causes of primary hypopituitarism are pituitary adenoma and complications from surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary adenoma. In rare cases, hypopituitarism has been observed when the infection occurs. Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by the postpartum hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. In still rarer cases, solitary or complicated pituitary hormone deficiency syndromes may occur due to genetic causes and typically affect children. The treatment of hypopituitarism typically involves a replacement of the deficient hormone but care must be taken because several studies have reported an increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders and number of deaths among these patients.

NAME        Pituitary TSH hypersecretion;
            Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of TSH (SITSH)
DESCRIPTION Pituitary TSH hypersecretion is disease of the anterior portion of the pituitary resulting in hypersecretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). It includes two forms of central hyperthyroidism, i.e. TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma) and resistance to thyroid hormone action (RTH). The incidence of hyperthyroidism due to a TSHoma is extremely low, 1-2% of all cases of hyperthyroidism. Most of the tumors are macroadenomas usually presenting with symptoms such as headache and/or visual field impairment while the symptoms of hyperthyroidism seem to be milder compared with those caused by primary hyperthyroidism. First-line treatment of TSHoma is pituitary adenomectomy followed by irradiation in the case of surgical failure. However, medical treatment with somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide and lanreotide, are effective in reducing TSH secretion.

NAME        Eating Disorders, including:
            Anorexia nervosa;
            Bulimia nervosa;
            Binge eating disorder
DESCRIPTION Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), are disorders defined by disturbances in eating behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated. Other genetic risk factors for eating disorders has also been reported.

NAME        Sudden sensorineural hearing loss
DESCRIPTION Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is commonly defined as hearing loss of more than 30 dB, affecting three or more frequencies, arising over less than 3 days. The predominant form of sudden SNHL is unilateral in location, and the main aetiology is idiopathic. As the majority of patients (30-65 %) with unilateral sudden SNHL report spontaneous recovery within 2 weeks, unilateral disease is mostly regarded as a benign condition. Prognosis for recovery is dependent on a number of factors, including patient age, presence of vertigo at onset, degree of hearing loss, and time between onset of hearing loss and treatment. The pathology of sudden SNHL remains unclear. However, a series of factors, including viral infections, microcirculatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, and labyrinthine hemorrhage, have been proposed as causative factors. Different treatment regimens like antioxidants, corticosteroids, vasodilatators, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), or carbogen therapy have been described. Among these approaches, steroid treatment is the most common.

NAME        Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss
DESCRIPTION Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) represents a rare disease entity, constituting less than 5 % of all sudden SNHL cases. Unlike unilateral disease, bilateral sudden SNHL appears to be mostly related to serious systemic pathology, and is associated with a more severe degree of hearing loss, poorer prognosis following treatment, and more significant impairment in morbidity and overall quality of life.

NAME        Delayed endolymphatic hydrops
DESCRIPTION Delayed endolymphatic hydrops (DEH) is a disorder, characterized by episodic vertigo that develops some time after the onset of a profound, typically unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. DEH can be differentiated from Meniere's disease. The age of onset of symptoms is typically in later childhood and adolescence or between 40 and 60 years of age. DEH probably is caused by atrophy or fibrous obliteration of the endolymphatic resorptive system of the membranous labyrinth. It has been reported that genetic factors may sometimes be the cause of this disease. Two types of DEH exist: the ipsilateral type, in which the ear with profound hearing loss suffers progressive endolymphatic hydrops, and the contralateral type, in which the formation of progressive endolymphatic hydrops takes place in the ear opposite to the previously deafened ear. DEH requires conservative treatment, such as that typically used for Meniere's disease, including the appropriate concomitant use of diuretics, such as isosorbide or steroids for at least 3-6 months. When recurrent episodic vertigo cannot be remedied through conservative treatment, labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy on the deaf ear are curative for ipsilateral DEH. However, no such surgical treatment is available for the contralateral type.

NAME        Ossified ligamentum flavum;
            Ossification of the yellow ligament
DESCRIPTION Ossified ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a condition of heterotopic lamellar bone formation within the yellow ligament. OLF is a widely described pathology in eastern Asia and rare in other parts of the world. The disease process first causes hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and subsequent ossification, which narrows the spinal canal and leads to myeloradiculopathy. The lower thoracic spine is most commonly affected. Previous hyperkyphosis and mechanical stress are thought to be predisposing conditions. It is tempting to think that OLF is genetically or pathologically inherited based on abnormalities of calcium or phosphate metabolism, on endocrinologic abnormalities, or on the presence of autoimmune disease. Such relationships, however, have not been documented. Treatment of cervical stenosis related to OLF is based on the standard principle of managing neural spinal abnormalities. Acute episodes of pain and onset of or increase in neurological deficits are treated with rest, external spinal immobilization with a collar or brace, and analgesics, anti-inflammatory, and/or antispasmodic medicines. Surgery is indicated for patients with acute or chronic progression of neurological deficits or persistent neurological deficits.

NAME        Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis;
            Forestier disease;
            Ankylosing hyperostosis;
            Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament
DESCRIPTION Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), also known as Forestier disease, is a systemic noninflammatory disease characterized by ossification of the entheses. It affects mainly elderly men, and involves the ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL). Although it is asymptomatic in some occasions, the disease may produce dysphagia, dysphonia, and exceptionally breathing difficulties due to airway compromise. In these cases, early surgery is recommended to alleviate airway obstruction. Although the hallmark of the DISH is considered to be the anterolateral aspect of the thoracic spine, various signs and symptoms is not limited to the spine and has often been reported to involve multiple peripheral locations as well. While the cause of DISH remains unclear, mechanical factors, genetic factors, environmental factors, drugs, and metabolic conditions have been hypothesized to be relevant. Most of the current theories focus on the pathologic OALL. There's no cure for DISH. Therapy for DISH is based on symptomatic and empiric treatment. In general, physical therapy, analgesics, antiinflammatory drugs, and muscle relaxants have been successful in managing the majority of patients with DISH.

NAME        Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis
DESCRIPTION Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is a common and severe adverse event. Glucocorticoid use is one of the most important causes of osteonecrosis. In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30 to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9 to 40%. The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis. It has been indicated that bisphosphonates may rapidly reduce pain, and delay joint collapse in patients with osteonecrosis.

NAME        Mixed connective tissue disease
DESCRIPTION Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by a combination of clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis with elevated antibodies to U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP). The most common clinical manifestations of this disease are Raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgias, swollen joints, esophageal dysfunction, muscle weakness and fingers sausage-like appearance. The disease can be serious with development of pulmonary, kidney, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system manifestations. The worst prognosis and high mortality are associated with the presence of pulmonary disease. Therapy should be individualised for each patient to address the specific organs involved and the severity of underlying disease activity. Inflammatory manifestations usually respond to steroid treatment, whereas clinical sclerodermatous manifestations such as sclerodactyly, and pulmonary interstitial disease more often require cytotoxic immunosuppressive treatment.

NAME        Spinal stenosis
DESCRIPTION Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal that mainly occurs in the cervical and lumbar regions. Cervical stenosis presents with axial neck pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy, or a combination of these presentations. Axial pain refers to pain that occurs along the spinal column, while radiculopathy refers to complaints in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution often occurring in the arms. Patients may complain of numbness, pain or loss of function. Myelopathy refers to a cluster of complaints and findings due to intrinsic damage to the spinal cord itself. Patients might report numbness, coordination and gait issues, grip weakness and bowel and bladder complaint. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a major cause of pain and functional disability for the elderly. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are a hallmark of lumbar spinal stenosis, where patients develop low back or leg pain when walking or standing that is relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion. The treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis generally begins with conservative management such as physical therapy, home exercise programs, and oral analgesics. Once these therapies fail, patients commonly move forward with interventional pain treatment options such as epidural steroid injections (ESIs), nerve block, or surgery as the next step. Coexisting lumbar and cervical stenosis (tandem spinal stenosis) is an infrequent presentation with mixed presentation of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs. But very few reports of tandem spinal stenosis are available.

NAME        Fulminant hepatic failure;
            Fulminant hepatitis
DESCRIPTION Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the rapid deterioration of liver functions and hepatic encephalopathy. FHF is with the basic definition of the onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of the appearance of the first symptoms like jaundice, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The prothrombin time is prolonged by 4-6 seconds or more. While the etiologies of FHF are multiple and varied, viral hepatitis is the most frequent cause. Around 40-60% of patients with FHF are thought to be due to some viral infection. The prognosis is dependent on several factors, including the underlying cause of liver failure. For instance, it is well known that the spontaneous recovery rates from FHF from such etiologies as hepatitis A and acetaminophen toxicity are high, whereas those same rates for other types of viral hepatitis and idiosyncratic drug reactions are quite low. Identification of the cause of FHF is important because some causes have specific treatment interventions or antidotes. Specific therapies include N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose, and acyclovir for herpesvirus infection. Different therapeutic options such as complete exchange blood transfusion, corticosteroids, and plasma pheresis, have been tried. However, the overall prognosis for patients with FHF is quite poor, with survival rates usually reported between 10% and 30% without liver transplantation.

NAME        Diffuse panbronchiolitis
DESCRIPTION Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease, which predominantly affects East Asians. Clinically, DPB is characterized by chronic inflammation of the respiratory bronchioles and sinobronchial infection. While DPB is frequently compared with cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease encountered in Caucasians, neither pancreatic insufficiency nor any obvious abnormalities of the sweat electrolytes are seen in DPB, and the two are considered to be entirely different diseases. Immunogenetic studies revealed a strong association with human HLA-B54 in Japanese, whereas an association with HLA-A11 was reported in Koreans. These findings imply that a major susceptibility gene may be located between the HLA-A and HLA-B loci on the short arm of human chromosome 6. Recently, novel mucin-like genes has been cloned in this candidate region. And it was found that their polymorphisms were associated with DPB. Over the past two decades, DPB has shifted from being a near-fatal to a treatable disease. A significant improvement in the prognosis of this disease has been attributed to the long-term use of macrolides. The five-year survival rate increased to about 90% after treatment with erythromycin became widely used.

NAME        Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);
            Emphysema
DESCRIPTION Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.

NAME        Obesity hypoventilation syndrome;
            Pickwickian Syndrome
DESCRIPTION Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined as the triad of obesity (BMI of 30 or higher), daytime hypoventilation, and sleep-disordered breathing in the absence of any other cause of hypoventilation. The features include marked obesity, somnolence, twitching, cyanosis, periodic respiration, polycythemia, and right ventricular hypertrophy and failure. Patients with untreated OHS have a significant risk of death. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatments may temporize cardiopulmonary disease progression, simultaneous pursuit of weight reduction is central to long-term management of this condition.

NAME        Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias
DESCRIPTION Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) are a heterogeneous subset of interstitial lung diseases, characterized by unknown aetiology. Despite the varied nature of IIPs, the common histological feature is distortion of lung interstitium by highly variable combinations of inflammation and fibrosis. Patients experience common symptoms related to their chronic lung disease. Dyspnoea, cough, fatigue and depression contribute substantially to morbidity and are often difficult to manage. It has been reported that pulmonary rehabilitation plays a central role in symptom management and has beneficial effects. According to the current American thoracic society/European respiratory society (ATS/ERS), IIPs are categorised as major IIPs, rare IIPs and unclassifiable IIPs. There are six major IIPs, namely, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). And they are divided into three major groups;  chronic fibrosing IIP (IPF, NSIP), smoking-related IIP (RB-ILD, DIP), and acute/ subacute IIP (COP, AIP). The rare IIPs include idiopathic lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) and idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. IPF accounts for the majority of IIP. It is considered to be lethal because prognosis is very poor and far worse than other types of IIP. An early and accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical.

NAME        Optic neuritis
DESCRIPTION Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the optic nerve that presents with an abrupt loss of vision. The majority of patients are between the ages of 20 and 50 years, with a mean age ranging from 30 to 35 years. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. The onset is usually with pain on eye movement in one eye and subacute visual loss. One-third of patients have a mildly edematous optic disc. The visual disturbance resolves in 95% of cases. Many cases of optic neuritis are associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or can occur in isolation. Occasionally, optic neuritis can result from infectious processes involving the paranasal sinuses or occur in the course of a systemic viral infection. High-dosed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy speeds recovery but does not improve the final outcome. For patients judged to be at high risk of developing multiple sclerosis, immune prophylaxis with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate is recommended.

NAME        Kawasaki disease;
            Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome
DESCRIPTION Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of childhood that does not have a known cause or aetiology. KD is a self-limited illness that is not associated with the production of autoantibodies or the deposition of immune complexes, and it rarely recurs. The disease is believed to result from an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. Classic (typical) Kawasaki disease is diagnosed based on the presence of a fever lasting five or more days, accompanied by four out of five findings: bilateral conjunctival injection, oral changes such as cracked and erythematous lips and strawberry tongue, cervical lymphadenopathy, extremity changes such as erythema or palm and sole desquamation, and polymorphous rash. Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease occurs in persons with fever lasting five or more days and with two or three of these findings. The standard treatment of acute KD is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion and aspirin. However, 10-20% of patients show resistance to IVIG therapy and present higher risk of coronary vasculitis. If there is no response to treatment, patients are given a second dose of IVIG with or without corticosteroids or other adjunctive treatment.

DESCRIPTION Optic neuropathy is damage to the optic nerve that causes vision loss frequently. The optic nerve is susceptible to a number of pathologic processes. Causes of the disease include demyelinating, inflammatory, toxic, nutritional, compressive, infiltrative, hereditary, traumatic, and neoplastic. The classic clinical signs of optic neuropathy are visual field defect, dyschromatopsia, and abnormal papillary response. A rapid onset is typical of demyelinating, inflammatory, ischemic, and traumatic causes.

NAME        Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO)
DESCRIPTION Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a very common condition in the aboriginal peoples from Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and southern Thailand, in areas where malaria is endemic, with prevalence varying between 5% and 25%. SAO is now known to be caused by a 27 base-pair deletion in SLC4A1, which codes for band 3, a 911 amino acid protein that is both a structural component of the red cell membrane cytoskeleton and the chloride-bicarbonate anion-exchanger in this membrane. SAO is believed to have evolved because these parts of Southeast Asia historically have had a high incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, against which SAO offers clinical protection. Individuals with SAO are characterized as having oval-shaped red blood cells with increased membrane rigidity and decreased anion transport, but no clinical symptoms beyond sporadic associations with anemia in both adults and neonates. The diagnosis is made accidentally as a result of a peripheral blood smear examination, showing the characteristic rounded elliptocytes (ovalocytes).

NAME        Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease;
            Goodpasture syndrome
DESCRIPTION Goodpasture syndrome (GS), or anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, is a rare and organ-specific autoimmune disease defined by anti-GBM antibody-mediated damage (mainly immunoglobulin G-1) resulting in progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis and, frequently, diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. Clinically, GS is characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure, although the clinical spectrum may range from only mild symptoms to a relentless and finally lethal outcome. This disease accounts for 10-20% of the patients with acute renal failure following a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The disease is caused by an autoimmune response against the non-collagenase domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen [alpha3(IV)NC1], found in the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, the disease can lead to bleeding in the lungs, kidney failure, and even death. Early and intensive treatment with plasmapheresis and immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids pending results of diagnostic testing, and later cyclophosphamide, is often beneficial, with 90% of patients surviving the acute presentation of GS.

NAME        Galloway-Mowat syndrome
DESCRIPTION Galloway-Mowat Syndrome (GMS) is an autosomal recessively inherited condition characterized by the association of nephrotic syndrome and central nervous system involvement. Several case reports and studies on small series describing the clinical and histopathological features of GMS have revealed the clinical heterogeneity of this condition. The consistent morphological hallmark is microcephaly, which is often present at birth (primary microcephaly) but might also develop postnatally (secondary microcephaly). Major brain abnormalities include cerebral atrophy and neural-migration defects, such as agyria, microgyria, or polymicrogyria. These structural brain abnormalities are associated with severe psychomotor impairment, hypotonia, and seizures in half of all cases. The nephrotic syndrome occurs in the first four months of life with an average of three months, and a congenital nephrotic syndrome has rarely been described. This nephrotic syndrome is steroid-resistant and associated with a constant and rapid deterioration of renal function. Death usually occurs within few years from the onset. Very recently, WDR73 deficiency was identified as the cause of GMS.

NAME        Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
DESCRIPTION Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins. It can lead to complications such as postphlebitic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and death. DVT has genetic and acquired risk factors. The genetic risk factors can be subdivided into those that are strong, moderate and weak. Strong risk factors are deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S. Moderately strong are factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, non-O blood group and fibrinogen 10034T. There are many weak genetic risk factors, including fibrinogen, factor XIII and factor XI variants. Acquired risk factors include surgery, oral contraceptives, trauma, obesity, cancer, and so on. In some patients, venous thrombosis occurs in the presence of such risk factors for DVT. These patients are classified as having secondary DVT. In the other patients, no predisposing factors are found, and thus, are considered as having an idiopathic DVT.

DESCRIPTION Human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic progressive myelopathy characterized by bilateral pyramidal tract involvement with sphincteric disturbances. HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of HAM/TSP. Although the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic during their lifetime, approximately one percent of this population develops a myelopathy consisting of a chronic inflammation of the white and gray matter of the spinal cord. Early in the disease process the leptomeninges, blood vessels and parenchyma are infiltrated with CD4+, CD8+, B lymphocytes and foamy macrophages, whereas later in the disease CD8+ lymphocytes predominate with subsequent progression to a relatively acellular, atrophic pattern with axonal and myelin degeneration.

NAME        Primary immunodeficiency diseases
DESCRIPTION Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are genetically determined disorders of the immune system resulting in greatly enhanced susceptibility to infectious disease, autoimmunity and malignancy. Many are associated with single gene defects, whereas others may be polygenic or may represent interactions of genetically determined characteristics with environmental or infectious stresses. There are more than 150 different disorders which have been described till date. PIDs are broadly classified as disorders of adaptive immunity (i.e., T-cell, B-cell or combined immunodeficiencies) or of innate immunity (e.g., phagocyte and complement disorders).  Early diagnosis and treatment are imperative for preventing significant disease-associated morbidity.

NAME        Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, including:
            Dense deposit disease (DDD);
            C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN);
            Immunoglobulin-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
DESCRIPTION Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) represents a pattern of glomerular injury, characterized by mesangial proliferation and expansion, lobularization of the glomerular tufts and double contours. Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis. The two entities are distinguished on the basis of the immunohistological pattern of C3 and the electron microscopy detection of ribbon-like electron-dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane in DDD, versus deposits of usual density in C3 glomerulonephritis.

NAME        Primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome
DESCRIPTION Primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (PAHS) is a rare disorder which shows hypoxemia and hypercapnia without apparent associated pulmonary, neuromuscular, and central nervous diseases. PAHS is characterized by exacerbation of hypoxemia during sleep. Disorders of both automatic and chemical control of ventilation are considered as a cause of this syndrome. PAHS occuring during infancy is called congenital cenral alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Although the relationship between CCHS and adult onset PAHS is unclear, the familial occurrence of PAHS may suggest an underlying genetic mechanism. It has been represented that some adult onset PAHS may be a mild type of CCHS. Recently, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has become available for PAHS.

NAME        Potter syndrome;
            Potter sequence
DESCRIPTION Potter syndrome is a rare fatal disorder that occurs in sporadic and hereditary forms. It affects predominantly male babies and is accompanied by severe oligohydramnios, polycystic kidney, bilateral renal agenesis, and obstructive uropathy during middle gestational weeks. Renal failure is the main defect in Potter syndrome. Other characteristic features include premature birth, breech presentation, atypical facial appearance, and limb malformations. Severe respiratory insufficiency leads to a fatal outcome in most infants. Potter syndrome has been divided into 4 distinct subgroups. Potter syndrome type I is referred to as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), type II as renal dysplasia, type III as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and type IV occurs when a longstanding obstruction in either the kidney or ureter leads to cystic kidneys or hydronephrosis. Particularly types II-IV can be part of many syndromes.

NAME        Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs);
            Premature ventricular contractions
DESCRIPTION Premature ventricular complex (PVC) is characterized by the premature occurrence of a QRS complex that is bizarre in shape and lasts longer than 120 msec. The T wave is large and usually of opposite polarity to the QRS complex. A PVC is usually followed by a full compensatory pause. PVCs are commonly encountered in apparently healthy individuals with a reported incidence of approximately 1% on standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and 40% to 75% on routine 24 hour to 48 hour Holter monitoring. The clinical presentation may range from asymptomatic to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with congestive heart failure. In many patients, ectopic ventricular events manifest as asymptomatic, isolated PVCs that have a benign prognosis in those without structural heart disease. In others, PVCs may be frequent and highly symptomatic, presenting as palpitations, chest discomfort, or presyncope. Clinical evidence suggests that frequent PVCs (variably defined in the literature) are more strongly associated with concomitant cardiac disease. The decision to suppress PVCs is largely based on the presence of symptoms, interference with other therapy (e.g., cardiac resynchronization therapy), or suspicion of PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy. When necessary, treatment for PVCs involves beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or other antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation in selected cases. Catheter ablation of frequent PVCs has been demonstrated to be effective at PVC suppression and is associated with improvement or normalization of ventricular function.

NAME        Myocardial infarction
DESCRIPTION Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a term for an event of heart attack. It is due to formation of plaques in the interior walls of the arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart and injuring heart muscles because of lack of oxygen supply. The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack. Nitroglycerin and antihypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors may also be used to lower blood pressure and to improve the oxygen demand of heart.

NAME        Werner syndrome
DESCRIPTION Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder with a complex phenotype, which includes many age-related disorders that develop from puberty, including greying and thinning of the hair, bilateral cataract formation, type II diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and atherosclerosis. WS patients also experience an increased risk of rare non-epithelial cancers, especially sarcomas. Death usually occurs in the fourth decade from cardiovascular compromise or cancer. WS is caused by mutation of WRN gene, that play a major role in genome stability, particularly during DNA replication and telomere metabolism.

NAME        Rothmund-Thomson syndrome
DESCRIPTION Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that presents with growth deficiency, photosensitivity with poikilodermatous skin changes, cataracts, early greying and loss of hair, and an increased incidence of cancer, including osteosarcoma and hematological malignancy. RTS is caused by mutations in RECQL4 helicase. RECQL4 is shown to be important protein for DNA replication, repair, and telomere maintenance.

NAME        Lymphangiomatosis
DESCRIPTION Lymphangiomatosis is a well-recognized congenital benign tumour, frequently seen in infancy and childhood, characterized by the presence of multiple lymphangiomas. The lymphangiomatosis spectrum encompasses a remarkable heterogeneity in its potential presentation, including micro- and macrocystic isolated lymphatic malformations, thoracic and intraabdominal diffuse lymphangiomatosis, and osseous and soft-tissue presentations known as Gorham disease. The disease can be considered a failure of normal lymphatic development, but the etiology remains poorly understood. Treatment has been limited to surgical resection or drainage procedures because there is no accepted effective systemic therapy.

NAME        Persistent truncus arteriosus
DESCRIPTION Persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) is a rare congenital condition in which a solitary arterial trunk arises from the base of the heart and supplies the coronary, pulmonary and systemic arteries. It is recognized as the most severe phenotype of outflow tract defect, and survival into adulthood is dismal without surgery. It is often associated with an unfavorable prognosis because complete surgical repair is not always possible. Mutations in the NKX2-6 gene and GATA6 gene have been found in patients with PTA. The association between truncus arteriosus and chromosome 22q11 deletion is well recognized.

DESCRIPTION Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a diverse group of disorders that encompass dozens of clinically and genotypically distinct diseases. It is characterized by mechanically fragile skin that readily blister. Most of the more severe subtypes are associated with clinically significant extracutaneous complications. Some subtypes may lead to death, even in early infancy. There are four major types of EB: EB simplex (H00584, H00585), junctional EB (H00586), dystrophic EB (H00587), and Kindler syndrome (H00588).

NAME        Noonan syndrome
DESCRIPTION Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, congenital cardiac defects, cryptorchidism in men, coagulation defects, and neurocognitive delay. In addition, individuals with NS have an increased risk of developing cancer. NS is caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Heterozygous, pathogenic variants in 11 known genes account for approximately 80% of cases. The most common gene associated with NS is PTPN11, which accounts for approximately 50% of all cases.

NAME        Polycystic ovary syndrome
DESCRIPTION Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder characterized by elevated androgen levels, menstrual irregularities, and/or small cysts on one or both ovaries. Clinical manifestations include oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, and frequently infertility. Clinical signs of PCOS include elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) levels, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are muted or unchanged. As a result of the increase in GnRH, stimulation of the ovarian theca cells, in turn, produces more androgens. Risk factors for PCOS in adults includes insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. PCOS can be described as an oligogenic disorder in which the interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors determine the heterogeneous, clinical, and biochemical phenotype. Management of clinical manifestations of PCOS includes oral contraceptives for menstrual irregularities and hirsutism. Treatment options for infertility include clomiphene, laparoscopic ovarian drilling, gonadotropins, and assisted reproductive technology.

NAME        Macrothrombocytopenia
DESCRIPTION Macrothrombocytopenia (MTP) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by enlarged and reduced numbers of circulating platelets, sometimes resulting in abnormal bleeding. The clinical presentations of MTP-affected individuals vary considerably and range from no symptoms to a severe bleeding tendency. MTP-causing mutations have been reported in several genes, involved in various functions such as cell signaling, cytoskeleton organization, and gene expression. Among these, the most common is MYH9, which is responsible for MYH9-related disease. The second most common are GP1BA, GP1BB, and GP, which are responsible for Bernard-Soulier syndrome.

            Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL)
DESCRIPTION Autoinflammation lipodystrophy and dermatosis syndrome (ALDD) is a systemic inflammatory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, cutaneous lesions, lipodystrophy, and visceral inflammatory manifestations. In 2011, several studies showed that a number of disorders referred to as joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome, Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome, Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), and chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome are caused by mutations in proteasome subunit beta type 8 (PSMB8) gene, indicating that these disorders are disease phenotypes along the same disease spectrum. Key symptoms include a persistent fever (higher than 38.5 degrees Celsius), steroid-sensitive erythema nodosum-like (edematous and purpuric) plaques, long clubbed fingers, hyperhidrosis, myositis, hepatosplenomegaly, macroglossia, facial and limbs lipoatrophy, and developmental (height, weight, and IQ) retardation. Skin biopsies show immature myeloid-lineage cells with mitoses. Some patients may have joint contracture, auricular and nasal chondritis, and calcification of the basal ganglia. Acute cardiovascular event is the leading cause of death in these patients for whom life expectancy is notably reduced. Management of these patients is by palliative care. The need for steroids is very high even in combination with anti IL-1, anti IL-6 or anti-TNF treatments.

NAME        Coronary artery disease
DESCRIPTION Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death globally. CAD is coupled to a pathogenic process in which lipids and lipoproteins accumulate in the subendothelial intimal layer of the vessel wall. A variety of environmental and genetic risk factors are associated with CAD, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and a family history of early CAD. It has been reported that an autosomal dominant form of CAD is caused by the mutation in transcription factor MEF2A. A missense mutation in LRP6, which encodes a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway, has also been identified.

NAME        Autoinflammation and PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID)
DESCRIPTION Autoinflammation and PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID) is a rare autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disease caracterized by early-onset recurrent erythematous plaques and vesiculopustular skin lesions associated with arthralgia, corneal erosions, and interstitial pneumonia. APLAID is an allelic disorder of PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (PLAID) with some overlapping features. A recent study demonstrated that a family with an autoinflammatory disease was found to have point mutations in the same CSH2 domain of PLCG2. The patients identified with APLAID developed recurrent sinopulmonary infections presumably due to a lack of class-switched memory B cells on lymphocyte immunophenotyping. The patients were partially responsive to anakinra and to high-dose corticosteroids.

NAME        Autoinflammatory syndrome with pyogenic bacterial infection and amylopectinosis;
            HOIL-1 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Autoinflammatory syndrome with pyogenic bacterial infection and amylopectinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic autoinflammation, invasive bacterial infections, and muscular amylopectinosis. Patients carried biallelic loss-of-expression and loss-of-function mutations in HOIL1 (RBCK1) gene coding for a component of the linear ubiquitination chain assembly complex (LUBAC). The patients developed recurrent episodes of fever and systemic inflammation with higher concentrations of acute-phase markers, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy very early in life. These features are commonly seen in the primary autoinflammatory diseases, although these HOIL-1-deficient patients failed to develop other cardinal features of the primary autoinflammatory diseases, such as pleuritis, pericarditis, peritonitis, or neutrophilic dermatoses.

NAME        Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by short stature, a characteristic face, cardiac defects, developmental delay and mental retardation. Affected individuals present with ectodermal abnormalities such as sparse, friable hair, hyperkeratotic skin lesions and a generalized ichthyosis-like condition. Typical facial characteristics include high forehead, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a depressed nasal bridge, and posteriorly angulated ears. CFC can be caused by mutations in BRAF, KRAS, MEK1, and MEK2, encoding components of the RAS-MAPK pathway.

NAME        STING-associated basculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI)
DESCRIPTION STING (stimulator of interferon genes)-associated basculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a rare hereditary autoinflammatory disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in TMEM173, the gene encoding the STING protein. It is considered that the mutations in the TMEM173 gene confer constitutive activation of STING and hypersensitivity to ligand stimulation, resulting in chronic activation of the STING-interferon pathway. Patients with SAVI have severe neonatal-onset small vessel vasculitis, which is expressed by telangiectatic ulcerative rashes in the limbs, earlobes, or nose, leading to microangiopathic thrombosis, vessel occlusion, and even risk of gangrene. Some SAVI patients may present chronic interstitial lung disease, which can be severe and lethal.

NAME        Achondroplasia
DESCRIPTION Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and the most frequent cause of short-limbed dwarfism. It is usually recognised at birth because of its distinctive clinical and radiographic features. Newborn infants with achondroplasia typically present with disproportionate shortening of the limbs, a long and narrow trunk, a large head with frontal bossing and midface retrusion. This disease is caused by mutations of the transmembrane receptor FGFR3, an important regulator of bone growth. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but in the majority of cases it results from de novo mutations. The most common complications of achondroplasia are medullary and radicular compressions due to spinal stenosis and deformities of the lower limbs. Most individuals with achondroplasia have normal intelligence.

NAME        Thanatophoric dysplasia
DESCRIPTION Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) is a congenital skeletal dysplasia characterized by marked underdevelopment of the skeletal system and short-limb dwarfism. It is the most common form of lethal skeletal dysplasia syndromes. Two types of TD have been described. Type I TD (TDI) is associated with curved and short femurs. The shortness of the bones in type II TD (TDII) is not as significant as in TDI. TDII is characterized by straight femurs and cloverleaf skull deformity. Other features common to type I and type II include short ribs, narrow thorax, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features, brachydactyly, hypotonia, and redundant skin folds along the limbs. Most affected infants die of respiratory insufficiency shortly after birth. Both TDI and TDII are caused by heterozygous fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) missense mutations. Its incidence is 1 in 20 000 to 50 000 births and it is an autosomal dominant condition. The mutation in most TD cases is de novo.
CATEGORY    Skeletal dysplasia
GENE        FGFR3 [HSA:2261] [KO:K05094]
COMMENT     TDI is known to arise because of five different mutations, all involving the substitution of an amino acid with a cysteine in FGFR3: Arg248Cys, Ser249Cys, Gly370Cys, Ser371Cys, and Tyr373Cys.

NAME        Antley-Bixler syndrome
DESCRIPTION Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) is a rare craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by radiohumeral synostosis. There is a wide spectrum of anomalies seen in ABS. Other features include midface hypoplasia, choanal stenosis or atresia, and multiple joint contractures. Two genetically distinctive forms have been observed. Type 1 ABS involves mutations in the FGFR2 gene without impairment of steroidogenesis. Type 1 ABS patients are with the most severe skeletal abnormalities but normal genitalia. Type 2 ABS involves mutations in the gene encoding cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), an enzyme which plays a direct role in steroidogenesis. Type 2 ABS is an autosomal recessive disorder, and it is associated with abnormal genitalia in both sexes due to impaired steroidogenesis. Mortality has been reported to be as high as 80% in the neonatal period, primarily due to airway compromise, and prognosis improves with increasing age.

NAME        Crouzon syndrome
DESCRIPTION Crouzon syndrome (CS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by generalized craniosynostoses, maxillary hypoplasia, widely spaced but shallow orbits with prominent globes. Heterozygous mutations of FGFR2 cause three classical craniosynostosis syndromes, Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer. Crouzon syndrome is usually the mildest of the FGFR2-associated disorders and the clinical diagnosis is suggested by the combination of characteristic facies and absence of major abnormalities of the hands and feet. It has also been reported that a mutation of FGFR3 gene causes Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans.

NAME        Pfeiffer syndrome
DESCRIPTION Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniosynostosis, brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia, and broad and deviated thumbs and great toes. Based on the severity of the phenotype, Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three subtypes. Type 1 involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities. It is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull. Mutations of the FGFR1 gene or FGFR2 gene can cause Pfeiffer syndrome.

            CARASIL
DESCRIPTION Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is a very rare autosomal recessive vascular disorder characterized by nonhypertensive cerebral small-vessel disease with early adulthood onset subcortical infarcts, progressive motor and cognitive impairment, alopecia, and spondylosis. Until recently, this disorder was almost exclusively reported in the Asian population. It has been found that CARASIL is associated with mutations in the HTRA1 gene encoding HtrA serine protease 1.

NAME        Relapsing polychondritis
DESCRIPTION Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare multisystemic disease widely accepted as a complex autoimmune disorder affecting proteoglycan-rich structures and cartilaginous tissues, including the ear, nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, peripheral joints, eye, heart, and skin, with high risk of misdiagnosis. The clinical spectrum may vary from intermittent inflammatory episodes leading to unesthetic structural deformities to life-threatening cardiopulmonary manifestations, such as airway collapse and valvular regurgitation. The diagnosis of RP is largely based on the clinical features and the role of laboratory investigations is purely supportive and to rule out other related or associated systemic diseases. Treatment in RP is largely symptomatic and a standard management protocol is yet to be established due to its rarity.

DESCRIPTION Autoimmune acquired factor XIII (F13) deficiency or autoimmune hemorrhaphilia resulted from the generation of anti-F13 antibodies (AHFXIII) is a rare but severe life-threatening bleeding disorder. In contrast, non-autoimmune hemorrhagic acquired F13 deficiency (HAF13D) is a less severe bleeding disease secondary to various disease conditions. AHFXIII must be distinguished from HAF13D since AHFXIII requires immunosuppressive therapy to eradicate autoantibodies in addition to F13 replacement therapy to arrest bleeding. Patients with acquired F13 deficiency, in particular those with AHFXIII, are on the increase, at least in Japan.

NAME        Hepatic glycogen storage disease
DESCRIPTION Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are inherited metabolic disorders of glycogen metabolism. They are divided into types 0 to XV, according to enzyme or transporter deficiency and organ distribution. The hepatic GSDs lead to hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia due to the lack of distribution of glucose to the organism. 80% of hepatic GSD is formed by types I, III, and IX. GSD I involves the liver, kidney and intestine, and the clinical manifestations are hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia. GSD IIIa patients display symptoms and signs due to the enzyme deficiency in liver, skeletal muscle and heart, whereas the remaining patients with GSD IIIb have only liver-related phenotypes. GSD IV usually presents in the first year of life, with hepatomegaly and growth retardation. GSD VI and IX are caused by a deficiency of the liver phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase system, and with usually moderate symptoms which manifest mainly in childhood.

            Immunoglobulin G4-positive multi-organ lymphoproliferative syndrome
DESCRIPTION Immunoglobulin G4-related disease is a distinct clinical entity characterised by hyper-IgG4 gammaglobulinemia and IgG4 positive plasma cell infiltration in the tissue. Other characteristic features of this syndrome include mass-forming lesion with fibrosis and prompt and good response to corticosteroids. This disease includes Mikulicz's disease (MD), autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, Kuttner's tumour, inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung, liver, and breast, retroperitoneal and mediastinal fibrosis, interstitial nephritis, autoimmune hypophysitis, and many other inflammatory conditions in multiple organs. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment; recently, rituximab, a select B-cell depleting agent, has been shown to provide an excellent clinical response in select patients.

NAME        Muscle glycogen storage disease
DESCRIPTION Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are inherited metabolic disorders of glycogen metabolism. They are divided into types 0 to XV, according to enzyme or transporter deficiency and organ distribution. Disorders of glycogen degradation may affect primarily the liver, the muscle, or both. GSD has been known to mainly be a liver disease with the exception of Pompe (GSD II), McArdle (GSD V), or Tarui (GSD VII) diseases. Recently, however, various muscular disorders involving different types of muscles have been described to be caused by defective glycogen metabolism. In the Muscle GSDs, the consequence of a block in skeletal muscle glycogenolysis, or in the glycolysis, is an impairment of muscular performance, owing to an increase in glycogen storage that disrupts contractile function and/or a reduced substrate turnover, which inhibits skeletal muscle ATP production.

NAME        Porphyria
DESCRIPTION Porphyria is an inborn error of heme biosynthesis porphyrin metabolism caused by deficiency of enzymes of porphyrin metabolism. The intermediates of this pathway (porphyrinogens, porphyrins and their precursors) are produced in excess and accumulate in tissues, resulting in neurological and/or photocutaneous symptoms, and hematological disturbances. Porphyrias are divided into erythropoietic and hepatic according to the predominant porphyrin-accumulating tissue. Erythropoietic porphyrias include erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), and the very rare hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). Hepatic porphyrias include ALA-dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and variegate porphyria (VP). Recently, a new type of erythroid porphyria, X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP) has been reported.

DESCRIPTION Polysplenia syndrome (PSS) is a rare subtype of heterotaxy syndrome with multiple spleens. It has been reported that most patients die before 5 years of age because the disease is often associated with congenital anomalies, such as cardiovascular anomalies. Some patients have a normal heart or only minor cardiac defects, are often diagnosed incidentally in patients being treated for other disease. The patient has bilateral bilobed lungs with hyparterial bronchi, abnormal location of abdominal solid organs and malrotation of bowels with multiple spleens. The etiology of PSS is not known yet. The causative factors of PSS are thought to be association of embryonic, genetic and teratogenic components.

            Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis
DESCRIPTION Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is an inflammatory pathological condition of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease worldwide, and CRS may be divided into ECRS and non-ECRS subtypes based on the presence of tissue eosinophilic infiltration or not. There are significant geographic and ethnic differences in the tissue eosinophilic infiltration, which is predominant in Western white patients and less common in East Asians, despite an increasing tendency for its prevalence in East Asia countries. ECRS commonly demonstrates more severe symptoms, polyp diseases with a higher incidence of bilateral polyps and sinonasal diseases on computed tomography, and the increase in blood eosinophils. Patients with ECRS exhibit clinical characteristics that include long term nasal congestion, mucus production, olfactory disturbances, bilateral nasal polyposis, and intermittent acute exacerbation of secondary bacterial infections. Since there is no approved medication to treat patients with ECRS with nasal polyps completely, surgery is often needed to clear the sinonasal passage, and repeated endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often required. The effectiveness of low-dose, long-term erythromycin treatment (macrolide therapy) was reported for the treatment of CRS in Japan.

NAME        Juvenile retinoschisis
DESCRIPTION Juvenile retinoschisis is an early-onset X-linked retinal disease caused by mutations in retinoschisin (RS1), extracellular protein implicated in retinal cell adhesion. This disease is the leading cause of macular degeneration in males and leads to splitting within the inner retinal layers leading to visual deterioration. Affected persons typically display cystic streaks projecting from the parafoveal region of the retina, and a reduction in the b-wave amplitude of the full-field electroretinogram (ERG). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) further reveals a splitting of the outer plexiform and adjacent retinal layers.

NAME        Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis
DESCRIPTION Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is a rare kidney disease leading to chronic kidney disease in a non-negligible percentage of patients. Generally, the prognosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura [DS:H01584] in children is favorable, but there are severe complications, one of which is renal involvement. HSPN is mainly characterized by acute episodes of glomerular inflammation with endocapillary and mesangial proliferation, fibrin deposits, and epithelial crescents that can heal spontaneously or lead to chronic lesions. HSPN and IgA nephropathy [DR:H01581] are currently considered related diseases resulting from glomerular deposition of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1. Although both nephritides present with similar histological findings and IgA abnormalities, they display pathophysiological differences with important therapeutic implications. Although there have been few evidence-based treatment strategies for HSPN, several studies have suggested that immunosuppressive drugs and multiple drug combination therapy were effective in ameliorating proteinuria and histological severity.

NAME        Central areolar choroidal dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) is a hereditary retinal disorder that principally affects the macula, often resulting in atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris in the center of the macula. Dysfunction of macular photoreceptors usually leads to a decrease in visual acuity, generally occurring between the ages of 30 and 60 years. In most cases, CACD is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait, although autosomal-recessive cases have been reported. Autosomal-dominant CACD is genetically heterogeneous but mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene (PRPH2) seem to be the most common cause. The PRPH2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific glycoprotein. It is believed to play an important role in the assembly, orientation, and physical stability of photoreceptor outer segment disks.

NAME        Congenital ichthyosis
DESCRIPTION The ichthyoses represent a large group of cutaneous disorders linked by the common finding of abnormal epidermal differentiation. These disorders are characterized by the cutaneous scaling, which is said to resemble the scales of a fish. Scaling can be localized or generalized and can be associated with a variety of additional cutaneous and/or systemic manifestations. In patients with ichthyosis, the barrier function of the skin is compromised and has a decreased ability to protect against bacterial or chemical assault and to prevent transepidermal water loss.  Ichthyosis vulgaris (H00735) is the most frequent type. X-linked ichthyosis (H00134) occurs almost exclusively in boys. Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (H00734) is genetically very heterogeneous and several different genes have been identified. Mutations in keratin genes are the cause of the keratinopathic ichthyoses (H00691), such as epidermolytic ichthyosis.

            X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita;
            Autosomal recessive adrenal hypoplasia congenita;
            IMAGe syndrome
DESCRIPTION Adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is an inherited disorder of the adrenal cortex commonly manifested as an early onset adrenal insufficiency syndrome. AHC includes X-linked form, a rare autosomal recessive form, and IMAGe syndrome. If untreated with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, adrenal insufficiency is rapidly lethal as a result of hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and shock. A constant feature of the X-linked AHC is the association with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG). Affected males typically have delayed puberty or arrested puberty caused by HHG. Mutations in the DAX-1 (NR0B1) gene are responsible for X-linked AHC. Autosomal recessive AHC is caused by mutations in SF-1 (NR5A1) gene. However, disruption of SF-1 only rarely causes adrenal insufficiency, usually in combination with testicular dysgenesis. IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies) is an autosomal dominant undergrowth developmental disorder with life-threatening consequences and caused by mutations in CDKN1C.

            Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome
DESCRIPTION 4p deletion syndrome, also known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), is a congenital disorder associated with various deformities. WHS is caused by deletion of the WHS critical resion (WHSCR) of chromosome 4p16.3. Because WHS is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, loss of one copy of a single gene or the synergistic effects of loss of two or more genes could give rise to the features of WHS. The "Greek warrior helmet appearance" is the most characteristic feature and refers to the facial view with prominent glabella, high arched eyebrow, broad nasal bridge and hypertelorism. Developmental delay and intellectual disability of variable degree is present in all. Seizures occur in 90% to 100% of children. Other findings include skeletal anomalies, congenital heart defects, hearing loss, urinary tract malformations, and structural brain abnormalities. Incidence is estimated to be about 1:50.000 births with a 2:1 female: male ratio.

DESCRIPTION Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata, also known as Van Buchem disease (VBD), is autosomal recessive disease. This disease is characterized by progressive bone overgrowth, with narrowing of the neuroforamina in the skull causing cranial neuropathies. VBD is due to a homozygous deletion of a 52-kb regulatory element 35 kb downstream of the SOST gene, which leads to impaired production of sclerostin. Sclerostin, the gene product of SOST, is an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

DESCRIPTION PCDH19-related epilepsy syndrome is a disorder characterized by the recurrence of seizures during infancy, which is often combined with intellectual disability or autistic features manifested exclusively in females. This disorder, first reported as epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females (EMFR) and recently renamed early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 9 (EIEE9). It was transmitted via asymptomatic males, suggesting an unusual X-linked inheritance with selective involvement of females. Mutations in the X-chromosome-encoded protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) cause this disorder, and are confirmatory for the diagnosis.

DESCRIPTION Aicardi syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. The main diagnostic features are agenesis of corpus callosum, chorioretinal lacunae, and infantile spasms. Along with agenesis of corpus callosum, typical brain abnormalities include polymicrogyria, periventricular and subcortical heterotopia, intracranial cysts, cerebellar abnormalities, and enlarged cisterna magna. Neurological abnormalities include microcephaly, optic nerve coloboma, developmental delay, mental retardation, intractable epilepsy, hypotonia and limb hypertonia with spasticity. The etiology of Aicardi syndrome is still unknown. However, as the disorder is only observed in females and in males with chromosome 47, XXY, it is assumed to be caused by a de novo mutation on the X chromosome and inherited in a dominant manner with lethality in males.

DESCRIPTION Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a rare hereditary disorder with joint contractures, generalized myotonia, skeletal anomalies, and facial dysmorphism. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a term now applied to 2 different autosomal recessive disorder, sometimes termed SJS type 1 and SJS type 2. SJS type 1 results from mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which encodes perlecan, a major component of basement membranes. It exhibits muscle stiffness, mild muscle weakness, and a number of minor morphological abnormalities. In affected patients, problems with motor development frequently become evident during the first year of life. SJS type 2, also known as Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (H00462), is a genetically distinct disorder with a more severe phenotype.

NAME        Non-dystrophic myotonia
DESCRIPTION Non-dystrophic myotonias are rare diseases caused by mutations in key skeletal muscle ion channels. The major clinical manifestation is muscle stiffness as a consequence of the myotonia. Additional common symptoms include pain, weakness and fatigue. They are considered to be distinct from myotonic dystrophy because of the absence of progressive weakness and systemic features. Non-dystrophic myotonias include myotonia congenita (H00705), paramyotonia congenita (H00743), and the sodium channel myotonias (H00744).

NAME        Autophagic vacuolar myopathy
DESCRIPTION Autophagic vacuolar myopathies (AVM) are a group of disorders united by shared histopathological features on muscle biopsy that include the aberrant accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. They are characterized by autophagic vacuoles in which the vacuolar membranes have sarcolemmal features, and include four entities: Danon disease, X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA), infantile AVM, and adult onset AVM with multiorgan involvement. Danon disease has been shown to be associated with mutations in the LAMP2 gene located on the X chromosome. XMEA is characterized by weakness and wasting primarily of the proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Mutations in the VMA21 gene at Xq28 cause XMEA by reducing the activity of lysosomal hydrolases.

NAME        Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder
DESCRIPTION Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (EGID) is a disorder characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common form of EGID is Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). Other forms of EGID include eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic enteritis, eosinophilic colitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE). While these disorders are less frequent than EoE, their pathogenesis and treatment are probably similar. Clinically, patients with EGID often present with dysphagia, vomiting or abdominal pain. While the etiology remains unclear, there is a well documented association of atopy with EGID. Clinical studies in children and adults have demonstrated an association with food allergy.

DESCRIPTION Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart abnormality, characterized by downward displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Displacement and malformation of the tricuspid valve is accompanied by an enlarged right atrium and a dilated, thinned right ventricle. Ebstein anomaly can occur as a sporadic or a familial defect. It has been reported that deletion 1p36 and deletion 8p23.1 are the most frequent chromosomal structural changes associated with Ebstein anomaly.

NAME        Primary hyperchylomicronemia, including:
            Hyperlipoproteinemia, type I [DS:H00154];
            Hyperlipoproteinemia, type V [DS:H00157]
DESCRIPTION Primary hyperchylomicronemia is characterized by a marked hypertriglyceridemia due to the accumulation of chylomicron occurs in the circulation. The main clinical symptoms of this disorder are the huge increase in plasma trigriceride and cholesterol, and the presence of xanthomatous eruption, lipemia retinalis, hepatosplenomegaly, and the complication of acute pancreatitis. The genetic basis for primary hyperchylomicronemia is heterogeneous. The familial chylomicronemia (known as Fredrickson's classification of type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia) [DS:H00154] is a clinical condition showing the severest hypertriglyceridemia and is classically represented by two rare genetic disorders, i.e., familial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency and familial apolipoprotein C-II deficiency. Even rarer conditions such as circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and the presence of autoantibodies also cause type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia. More recently, patients with primary hyperchylomicronemia caused by mutations in the gene for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) or lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1). By contrast, the more commonly encountered polygenic chylomicronemia of adulthood, referred to as mixed dyslipidemia (known as type 5 hyperlipoproteinemia) [DS:H00157], can present later in life and is characterized by increased levels of hepatically derived triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and triglyceride-rich remnant particles together with reduced levels of HDL cholesterol.

NAME        Tricuspid atresia
DESCRIPTION Tricuspid atresia is the third most common cyanotic congenital heart defect. It consists of complete lack of tricuspid valve formation, with no connection between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Severe cyanosis associated with diminished pulmonary blood flow is a prominent feature in tricuspid atresia. The malformation brings about high morbidity and mortality, thus requiring the utilization of an adequate surgical technique for its correction. The genetic mechanism responsible of tricuspid atresia is still obscure. However, animal models have suggested a role of cardiogenic Zfpm2/Fog2 and Hey2 genes in the pathogenesis.

NAME        Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries
DESCRIPTION Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a rare cardiac defect characterized by characterised by the combination of atrioventricular (AV) discordance and ventriculo-arterial (VA) discordance. The morphologic left ventricle and mitral valve supply the pulmonary circulation and the morphologic right ventricle and tricuspid valve supply the systemic circulation. The anatomy is described as congenitally 'corrected' because the flow of blood is normal with the deoxygenated systemic venous blood being pumped to the lungs and the well oxygenated pulmonary venous blood being pumped to the body. More than 90% of patients have additional anatomical abnormalities. The most frequent are ventricular septal defects, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and abnormalities of the tricuspid valve.

NAME        Univentricular Heart
DESCRIPTION Univentricular heart is a term used to describe a wide variety of structural cardiac abnormalities associated with a functional single ventricular chamber. Truly solitary ventricles are exceedingly rare. It is generally agreed that the atrioventricular connection is central in defining the univentricular heart. More specifically, the well-developed ventricle may be designated left, right, or indeterminate. Clinical manifestations hinge on the presence or absence of pulmonary outflow obstruction. Without pulmonary stenosis, infants with low pulmonary resistance present with signs and symptoms typical of large left-to-right shunting, ie, congestive heart failure and failure-to-thrive. A certain degree of pulmonary stenosis is physiologically desirable to prevent pulmonary overcirculation. However, severe pulmonary stenosis or atresia may result in profound hypoxemia and cyanosis.

Developmental delay/intellectual disability of variable degree and hypotonia are present in almost all patients. Seizures occur in around half of affected individuals. Other findings include structural brain abnormalities, congenital heart defects, eye/vision problems, hearing loss, skeletal anomalies, abnormalities of the external genitalia, and renal abnormalities. There is significant phenotypic variation among affected individuals. This variation is due, at least in part, to the genetic heterogeneity seen in 1p36 deletions which include terminal and interstitial deletions of varying lengths.

DESCRIPTION Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS), also referred to as the Say-Barber-Biesecker variant of Ohdo syndrome, is a rare multiple anomaly syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability, blepharophimosis, and a mask-like facial appearance. A number of individuals with SBBYSS also have thyroid abnormalities and cleft palate. In 1986, Ohdo described two siblings and their cousin with blepharophimosis, ptosis, congenital heart defects, intellectual disability, and hypoplastic teeth. Subsequently, the Young-Simpson syndrome was described. Later the Young-Simpson syndrome was renamed the Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson (SBBYS) variant of Ohdo syndrome. SBBYSS and genitopatellar syndrome (GPS) [DS:H01794] are clinically similar disorders with some overlapping features. They were found to be caused by de novo truncating sequence variants in the KAT6B (histone acetyltransferase) gene, strongly suggesting that they are allelic disorders.

NAME        Genitopatellar syndrome (GPS)
DESCRIPTION Genitopatellar syndrome (GPS) is a rare disorder in which patellar aplasia or hypoplasia is associated with external genital and renal anomalies, congenital flexion deformities of the limbs, distinctive facial features, corpus callosum agenesis, and severe intellectual disability. GPS and Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS) [DS:H01793] are clinically similar disorders with some overlapping features. They were found to be caused by de novo truncating sequence variants in the KAT6B (histone acetyltransferase) gene, strongly suggesting that they are allelic disorders. In GPS, the overall clinical picture tends to be more severe than in SBBYSS. Features present only in GPS are contractures, anomalies of the spine, ribs and pelvis, renal cysts, hydronephrosis, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Thyroid abnormalities have been reported in rare cases.

NAME        Blepharophimosis-mental retardation syndrome (BMRS);
            Ohdo syndrome
DESCRIPTION Blepharophimosis-mental retardation syndromes (BMRS) include a group of clinically and etiologically heterogeneous conditions, which can occur as isolated features or as part of distinct disorders displaying multiple congenital anomalies. The majority of syndromic patients with blepharophimosis show a variable degree of mental retardation. In 1986, Ohdo et al. delineated a syndrome of blepharophimosis, ptosis, hypoplastic teeth, heart defect, and mental handicap, to which his name was attached. Subsequently, several cases have been reported as Ohdo/Ohdo-like syndrome, widening the spectrum of clinical findings of BMRS, which lately were classified into five subtypes by Verloes et al: (1) del(3p) syndrome; (2) BMRS, Ohdo type; (3) BMRS, SBBYS (Say-Barber/Biesecker/Young-Simpson) type [DS:H01793]; (4) BMRS, MKB (Maat-Kievit-Brunner) type; (5) BMRS, Verloes type. BMR may also be found in relatively nonspecific developmental anomalies and in unclassified individuals, further widening the etiology of BMR disorders.

            Pili trianguli et canaliculi
DESCRIPTION Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is a rare anomaly of the hair shaft characterized by dry, frizzy, spangly, and often fair hair that is resistant to being combed flat. Both simplex and familial UHS-affected cases with autosomal dominant as well as recessive inheritance have been described. Recently, the identification of causative mutations were reported. No proven therapy exists. In the typical case, improvement may occur over time and spontaneous regression has been reported. Scanning electron microscopy of hair samples provides definitive evidence for diagnosis of clinically suspected UHS and eliminates other hair abnormalities from the differential diagnosis.

DESCRIPTION Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is an inherited autoimmune uveitis and vitreoretinal degeneration characterized by inflammatory cells in the vitreous and anterior chamber, photoreceptor degeneration, vitreous hemorrhages, epiretinal membranes (ERMs), and proliferative iris and retinal neovascularization. It is caused by mutations in CAPN5 gene, encoding an intracellular protease expressed in the retina. In most patients the diagnosis is difficult to make before age 40. Electroretinography can help make the diagnosis in younger individuals in whom the only other sign is the presence of vitreous cells.

DESCRIPTION Vibratory urticaria is a rare type of physical skin reactivity characterized by the occurrence of local erythematous, edematous, cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions that result from stimuli of a vibratory nature. A local stimulus of sufficient intensity will also result in generalized or facial erythema accompanied by a transient headache. The histamine release that is associated with urticarias has implicated aberrant degranulation of mast cells in their pathogenesis. A missense variant in ADGRE2 gene has been found in families with vibratory urticaria, implicating the encoded adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) as a mechanosensor in mast cells.

DESCRIPTION Paternal uniparental disomy 14 syndrome is characterized by characteristic face, a small bell-shaped thorax with coat-hanger appearance of the ribs, abdominal wall defects, placentomegaly and polyhydramnios. Human chromosome 14q32.2 carries a cluster of imprinted genes including paternally expressed genes (PEGs) such as DLK1 and RTL1 and maternally expressed genes (MEGs) such as MEG3, RTL1as (RTL1 antisense) and MEG8, together with the intergenic differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) and the MEG3-DMR. It has been reported that epimutations (hypermethylations) and microdeletions affecting the IG-DMR and/or the MEG3-DMR, result in paternal uniparental disomy 14 like phenotype. Recently, the name 'Kagami-Ogata syndrome' has been approved for this clinically recognizable disorder.

NAME        Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum
DESCRIPTION Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) is a severe cardiac malformation characterized by variable right ventricular development and imperforate pulmonary valve. PAIVS has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation ranging from cyanosis to shock due to closure of ductus arteriosus. The treatment follows initial stabilization with prostaglandin and establishment of antegrade flow. Because of the morphologic heterogeneity, repair or palliation strategies vary widely, ranging from single ventricle palliation to complete biventricular repair. Overall, regardless of anatomical subtype, survival is poor, reported to be as low as 50% at 5 years.

NAME        Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect
DESCRIPTION Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) is a rare and complex cyanotic congenital heart malformation that has a high incidence of early mortality. PA-VSD presents with complete absence of any communication between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries. The blood supply to the pulmonary arteries is provided by a patent arterial duct or by major aorto pulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). Two-thirds of the cases with pulmonary atresia are associated with MAPCAs, which can vary greatly in number and site of origin. PA-VSD shares similarities with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and has been considered a severe end of the spectrum of TOF. Although surgical interventions have been employed successfully for a number of years, the long-term prognosis has remained poor with an increased incidence of sudden death. An association between conotruncal cardiac abnormalities and 22q11.2 deletion during fetal life has been investigated and reported to occur in 20% of cases of PA-VSD.

NAME        Isaacs syndrome
DESCRIPTION Isaacs syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder of continuous muscle fibre activity resulting from peripheral nerve hyper excitability. Symptoms commonly include myokymia, pseudomyotonia, muscle cramps and stiffness. It is caused by voltage-gated potassium channel dysfunction and may be inherited or acquired. Recent evidences suggest that autoantibodies against voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC-Abs) are associated with this disease. Treatment commonly includes anticonvulsants, immunosuppressive therapy and plasma exchange.

NAME        Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome;
            Syndromic diarrhea
DESCRIPTION Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (THE), also known as syndromic diarrhea (SD), is a congenital enteropathy presenting with early-onset severe intractable diarrhea and associated with non-specific villous atrophy with low or no mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria nor specific histological abnormalities involving the epithelium. Infants are born small for gestational age. Patients present with facial dysmorphism, immune disorders and, in some patients, early onset of severe liver cirrhosis. It has been linked to abnormalities in two components of the putative human ski complex: SKIV2L and TTC37. During their clinical course, most of the patients require parenteral nutrition and often immunoglobulin supplementation.

NAME        Tenorio syndrome
DESCRIPTION Tenorio syndrome is a overgrowth syndrome characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, intellectual disability, mild hydrocephaly, hypoglycemia, and inflammatory diseases resembling Sjogren's syndrome. Mutations in RNF125, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, have been found from patients. It have been demonstrated that mutations in RNF125 result in a loss of function of RNF125 and dysregulation of the RIG-I-IPS1, PI3K-AKT, and interferon pathways.

NAME        Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids
DESCRIPTION Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) is an autosomal dominant central nervous system disease with variable clinical presentations, including personality and behavioral changes, dementia, depression, parkinsonism, seizures and other phenotypes. HDLS is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease with symptomatic onset in midlife and death within a few years after symptom onset. White matter lesions with accumulation of axonal spheroids are the pathological hallmark of HDLS. It has been reported that mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene cause this disease. CSF1R is a crucial mediator of microglial proliferation and differentiation in the brain.

NAME        Sturge-Weber syndrome
DESCRIPTION Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare sporadic neurocutaneous syndrome the hallmark of which is a facial port-wine stain (PWS) involving the first division of the trigeminal nerve, ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomata, and angioma of the eye (leading to glaucoma). The clinical course is highly variable but usually progressive course in early childhood characterised by seizures, stroke-like episodes, headaches, neurological and cognitive deterioration, hemiparesis, glaucoma and visual field defects. Although patients with a PWS plus leptomeningeal involvement alone are generally diagnosed as having SWS, those with a facial PWS and glaucoma alone are usually classified separately or considered as having partial SWS. Leptomeningeal and choroidal vascular anomalies have also been described in the absence of a PWS and may represent another partial variant of SWS. A somatic activating missense mutation in the GNAQ gene was recently identified in affected tissues (both skin and brain). This gene encodes the Q-class G protein alpha-subunit, activation of which increases MAPK signaling. Standard treatment includes laser therapy for the birthmark, control of glaucoma through eyedrops or surgery, and the use of anticonvulsants. Treatment with an anticonvulsant or low-dose aspirin or both before the onset of seizures is an option.
